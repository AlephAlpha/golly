/**
 *   Encapsulate a class capable of rendering a life universe.
 *   Note that we only use fill rectangle calls and blitbit calls
 *   (no setpixel).  Coordinates are in the same coordinate
 *   system as the viewport min/max values.
 *
 *   Also note that the render is responsible for deciding how
 *   to scale bits up as necessary, whether using the graphics
 *   hardware or the CPU.  Blits will only be called with
 *   reasonable bitmaps (32x32 or larger, probably) so the
 *   overhead should not be horrible.  Also, the bitmap must
 *   have zeros for all pixels to the left and right of those
 *   requested to be rendered (just for simplicity).
 *
 *   If clipping is needed, it's the responsibility of these
 *   routines, *not* the caller (although the caller should make
 *   every effort to not call these routines with out of bound
 *   values).
