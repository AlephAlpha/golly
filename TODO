For future versions:
--------------------

A - Stop generating if pattern becomes empty, constant or p2 (qlife only)
    and display suitable message in status bar.  Or maybe just add
    Gabriel's oscillation detection as an option (see oscar.py).

A - Replace separate Go and Stop buttons with a single button, optionally
    animated to show galaxy phases.  Looks like I'll need to avoid using
    wxToolBar (probably good anyway, as it causes other bugs).

T - Improve batchmode.

- Add ability to let users assign their own keyboard shortcuts.
  First step would be to allow users to edit *_key=char settings in
  GollyPrefs, then (much harder) write a nice UI to change settings
  in Prefs > Keys.  Use KeyBinder code at wxcode.sourceforge.net?

- Implement Undo (even just undoing the last draw would be very useful).

- Support toroidal universes (see LifeLab).

- Add note(str) command to display multi-line text (without a beep).
  Add info() command to display current pattern info.
  Add help(html-file) to open the help window and display contents of
  given html file (not necessarily in Help folder).

- Try to fix/avoid X11 problem with vertical tool bar.  Maybe just
  avoid wxToolBar and implement our own simple tool bar stuff.

- Check if wx can support vbr synchronization when buffering.

- Optimize Mac version to use CopyBits rather than wx's DrawBitmap.
  NB. Means creating non-XBM bitmaps (ie. no bit reversal).
  Or turn on wx_USE_CORE_GRAPHICS and see if that improves speed?

- Allow non-rectangular (and disjoint?) selections.

- Create nicer tool bitmaps; ie. make them more like buttons.
  PROBLEM: wxMac scales 22x22 buttons down to 16x16!

- Implement a history bar for hlife.

- If other X11 apps like xlife or fontforge allow clipboard support
  then examine their source code and use it.

- Build the Help menu items dynamically by looking at the .html files
  inside the Help folder.  Or maybe read a special Help/menu.data file?

- Add simple methuselah/spaceship/osc/still-life searches as in LifeLab???

User suggestions:
-----------------

[Nick Gotts]
- Need a way to copy exact gen/pop counts to clipboard.
  No longer necessary now that Python commands can get such info?

[Paul Chapman]
- Combine the start and stop toolbar buttons into a single toggle.
  If we provide an animating stop button then make it optional (via Prefs).

[Jason Summers]
- The "move" cursor should be an open hand.
- For better viewing of patterns that move, have a way to automatically
  move the view X cells horizontally and Y cells vertically every Z gens.
- Allow diagonal selection rectangles.

[Dave Greene]
- Support a split-screen view of the universe.
- Provide some way to open current pattern file in user's text editor.
  Maybe just an "Edit Pattern" item in File menu?  And/or option-click
  on pattern/script in navigation panel?
- Provide a way to click-and-drag a selection to move it around.
- Make page and arrow scrolling amounts configurable (in Prefs > View).
- Add a getvisrect() script command that returns current viewport rect
  and a setvisrect(rect) command to change viewport size and location.
- Nicer if getrule always returned a standard form; eg. "B3/S23".
  Could then remove horrible CanonicalRule code in wxrule.cpp.

[H Koenig]
- Mulitiple undo/redo.
- Multiple windows.

[Gabriel Nivasch]
- Make paste pattern semi-transparent.
- Add a Default button to each Preferences pane (at bottom left?).

[Bill Gosper]
- Add a setgen(str) script command.
- Modify info window so it can be used to edit and save comments.
- For scales > 1:1 make the pixel color depend on lg(# of ones in it).
