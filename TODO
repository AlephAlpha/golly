TODO:

High priority:
--------------

A - Split up wxgolly.cpp into smaller modules:
    wxmain, wxstatus, wxfile, wxedit, wxcontrol, wxview, wxhelp, wxprefs, etc.
    Also tidy up the code (follow http://www.wxwidgets.org/standard.htm?).

A - Create a scrollable navigation panel to view contents of a selected
    folder (initially Patterns) so users can load patterns easily.

A - Add a pop-up menu with named rules to rule dialog.

A - Stop generating if pattern becomes empty, constant or p2 (qlife only)
    and display suitable message in status bar.

B - Finish 1D rule support.  Basically works except for qlife display being
    upside down (so just alter rule0 table in qlifealgo::setrule?).
    Also prevent odd-numbered W rules (only feasible in toroidal universe).
    Decide how to store 1D rule in RLE file -- time for #RLE+ extensions?!

B - Add more info to INSTALL file (and rename to BUILD?):
    - how to install wxWidgets, esp on Windows (point to wxWiki page)
    - briefly describe each module
    - list steps needed to add a new life algo (eg. toroidal universe)
    - describe batch version

For future versions:
--------------------

T - Improve batchmode.

A - See if we can reduce app size.  If wx docs no help then ask wx-users.

A - Try to fix/avoid X11 problem with vertical tool bar.  Maybe just
    avoid wxToolBar and implement our own simple tool bar stuff.

A - Need white crosshair cursor for Win app when white-on-black.
    Or does Win support an XOR cursor mode?

A - Check if wx can support vbr synchronization when buffering.

- Add Gabriel's oscillation detection as an option (see LifeLab).

- Support toroidal universes (see LifeLab).

- Optimize Mac version to use CopyBits rather than wx's DrawBitmap.
  NB. Means creating non-XBM bitmaps (ie. no bit reversal).

- Add more sophisticated editing (rotate selection, etc).

- Implement Undo (even just undoing the last draw would be very useful).

- Allow non-rectangular (and disjoint?) selections.

- Create nicer tool bitmaps; ie. make them more like buttons.
  PROBLEM: wxMac scales 22x22 buttons down to 16x16!

- Let user change spacing of dark grid lines.

- Let user specify colors for live/dead cells.  Only slightly tricky
  part is dynamically choosing nice colors for the grid lines.

- Implement a history bar for hlife.

- Add ability to let users assign their own keyboard shortcuts.
  See KeyBinder code at wxcode.sourceforge.net.

- If other X11 apps like xlife or fontforge allow clipboard support
  then examine their source code and use it.

- Build the Help menu items dynamically by looking at the .html files
  inside the Help folder.  Or maybe read a special Help/menu.data file?

- Allow app to be automated by some sort of scripting language.
  Devise our own cross-platform language or use something else.
  See wxScript code at wxcode.sourceforge.net.

- Add simple methuselah/spaceship/osc/still-life searches as in LifeLab???

User suggestions:
-----------------

[Nick Gotts]
- Need a way to see the exact number of generations, population size, and
  mouse coordinates (and copy them to clipboard).

[Paul Chapman]
- Allow grid display for zoom level 1:4.
- Combine the start and stop toolbar buttons into a single toggle.

[Gabriel Nivasch]
- The shortest delay should be much shorter than 0.25s; maybe 0.01s.
- Finer control of the running speed; ie. allow step inc of 2.

[Jason Summers]
- The "move" cursor should be an open hand.
- "Open Pattern" and "New Pattern" should remove any existing selection.
- More available zoom scales would be nice, e.g. 1:3 and 1:6.
- Shrink the scrollbar thumbs and/or increase their scroll rate, to allow
  scrolling more than 1 screenful at a time.
- Need faster way to select cursor modes; eg. use F5 to F8.
- For better viewing of patterns that move, have a way to automatically
  move the view X cells horizontally and Y cells vertically every Z gens.
- Display a ghost image when pasting pattern.
- Allow diagonal selection rectangles.
- Modify the source code to better support Visual C++ 6.

[Dave Greene]
- Animate just the selection, or everything outside the selection.
  Use LifeLab's method: shift-space and control-space.
- Support a split-screen view of the universe.
- Provide some way to open current pattern file in user's text editor.
  Maybe just an "Edit Pattern" item in File menu?  And/or option-click
  on pattern in navigation panel?
