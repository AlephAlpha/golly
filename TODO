TODO:

High priority:
--------------

T - Make readpattern handle gzip'ed files (only Windows left to do).

A - Create Patterns folder for distribution [Dave Greene is doing it].

A - Stop generating if pattern becomes empty, constant or p2 (qlife only)
    and display suitable message in status bar.

B - Finish 1D rule support.  Basically works except for qlife display being
    upside down (so just alter rule0 table in qlifealgo::setrule?).
    Prevent odd-numbered W rules (only feasible in toroidal universe).

A - Polish .html files (eg. remove all "!!!" stuff).

B - Add more info to INSTALL file:
    - how to install wxWidgets, esp on Windows (point to wxWiki page)
    - briefly describe each module
    - list steps needed to add a new life algo (eg. toroidal universe)
    - describe batch version

B - Add a "built with wxWidgets" logo+link (see www.wxwidgets.org/develop2.htm)
    to Golly's web site.

For future versions:
--------------------

T - Improve batchmode.

B - Requested by Nick Gotts: Need a way to see the exact number of generations,
    population size, and mouse coordinates (and copy them to clipboard?).
    Simplest soln might be to hit some special key like "?" and above info
    would appear in a scrollable text dialog for viewing/copying.

A - Split up wxgolly.cpp into smaller modules:
    wxmain, wxstatus, wxfile, wxedit, wxcontrol, wxview, wxhelp, wxprefs, etc.

A - Tidy up wx code (follow http://www.wxwidgets.org/standard.htm?).

A - Add an "Open Recent" submenu in File menu to keep track of up to 50(?)
    most recently loaded pattern files.  Just display full paths?
    Use wxArrayString to store and manipulate the paths.

A - Add a pop-up menu with named rules to rule dialog.

A - Try to answer/resolve all "???" and "!!!" comments in source files.

A - See if we can reduce app size.  If wx docs no help then ask wx-users.

A - Try to fix/avoid X11 problem with vertical tool bar.  Maybe just
    avoid wxToolBar and implement our own simple tool bar stuff.

A - Need white crosshair cursor for Win app when white-on-black.
    Or does Win support an XOR cursor mode?

A - Check if wx can support vbr synchronization when buffering.

- Add Gabriel's oscillation detection as an option (see LifeLab).

- Support toroidal universes (see LifeLab).

- Optimize Mac version to use CopyBits rather than wx's DrawBitmap.
  NB. Means creating non-XBM bitmaps (ie. no bit reversal).

- Add more sophisticated editing (rotate selection, etc).

- Implement Undo (even just undoing the last draw would be very useful).

- Allow non-rectangular (and disjoint?) selections.

- Create nicer tool bitmaps; ie. make them more like buttons.
  PROBLEM: wxMac scales 22x22 buttons down to 16x16!

- Let user change spacing of dark grid lines.

- Let user specify colors for live/dead cells.  Only slightly tricky
  part is dynamically choosing nice colors for the grid lines.

- Implement a history bar for hlife.

- Add ability to let users assign their own keyboard shortcuts.
  See KeyBinder code at wxcode.sourceforge.net.

- If other X11 apps like xlife or fontforge allow clipboard support
  then examine their source code and use it.

- Build the Help menu items dynamically by looking at the .html files
  inside the Help folder.  Or maybe read a special Help/menu.data file?

- Allow app to be automated by some sort of scripting language.
  Devise our own cross-platform language or use something else.
  See wxScript code at wxcode.sourceforge.net.

- Add simple methuselah/spaceship/osc/still-life searches as in LifeLab???

- Add isolated glider deletion as an option -- why bother???
