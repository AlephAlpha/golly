Welcome to Golly, a Game of Life simulator
by Tomas Rokicki and Andrew Trevorrow.

***** NOTE THAT THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE *****

Ready-to-run executables are available for all major platforms,
but if you need to build Golly from source code then you'll
have to install wxWidgets first (http://www.wxwidgets.org/).
After you do that, building Golly is easy.  Just use the
appropriate makefile:

   make -f makefile-x11    (on Linux or other X11 platforms)
   nmake -f makefile-win   (on Windows 98 or later)
   make -f makefile-mac    (on Mac OS X)
   
NOTE 1: Currently you need to edit makefile-win and makefile-mac
to specify where you installed wxWidgets.  We intend to avoid
that eventually!!!

NOTE 2: The code will only compile and run if your compiler
is set to use 32-bit integers and 32-bit pointers.
