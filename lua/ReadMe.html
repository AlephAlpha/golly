<p>
This directory contains the source files needed to embed Lua in Golly.
It's essentially the same set of files from the src directory in
the full distribution of Lua 5.4.8
(available <a href="https://www.lua.org/download.html">here</a>)
but with these minor changes:

<p>
<ul>
<li> Removed lua.c (the Lua stand-alone interpreter).
<li> Removed luac.c (the Lua compiler).
<li> Simplified Makefile (so it can be called from makefile-mac or makefile-gtk).
<li> Implemented <a href="https://github.com/Lekensteyn/lua-unicode">Peter Wu's patch</a>
     to support UTF-8 file paths on Windows.  This required adding two new files
     (utf8_wrappers.h, utf8_wrappers.c) and a tiny bit of code at the end of luaconf.h.
<ul>
