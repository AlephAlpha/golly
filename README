Welcome to Golly, a sophisticated tool for exploring Conway's
Game of Life and other cellular automata.

Key features:

- Unbounded universe (limited only by memory).
- Fast, memory-efficient conventional algorithm.
- Use hashing to see large patterns evolve at huge time scales.
- Responsive even while generating or garbage collecting.
- Reads RLE, Life 1.05/1.06, dblife, and macrocell formats.
- Can also read common graphic formats: BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF.
- Includes a state-of-the-art pattern collection.
- Supports other Life-like rules and Wolfram's 1D rules.
- Fast loading of large patterns.
- Paste in patterns from the clipboard.
- Unlimited undo/redo.
- Unbounded zooming out for astronomical patterns.
- Auto fit option keeps a generating pattern within view.
- Full screen option (no menu/status/tool/scroll bars).
- Supports multiple layers, including cloned layers.
- HTML-based help with integrated Life Lexicon.
- Scriptable via Perl or Python.
- Free, open source and cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
- We also provide bgolly, a GUI-less version.

The Golly application can be installed anywhere you like, but
make sure you move the whole folder because the Help subfolder
must be kept with the application.

To run Golly, just click on the application icon or type golly
on the command line.  See the Help menu for all the details.
The latest information can be found at the Golly web site:

Now go forth and generate!
