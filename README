Welcome to Golly, a sophisticated tool for exploring Conway's
Game of Life and other cellular automata.

Key features:

- Unbounded universes (limited only by memory).
- Multi-state universes (up to 256 states).
- Includes QuickLife, a fast, memory-efficient algorithm.
- Use HashLife to see large patterns evolve at huge time scales.
- Supports many different rules, including Wolfram's 1D rules,
  WireWorld, Generations, and John von Neumann's 29-state CA.
- Use RuleTable and RuleTree to load your own rules.
- Responsive even while generating or garbage collecting.
- Reads RLE, macrocell, Life 1.05/1.06, dblife, and MCell files.
  Can also read common graphic formats: BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF.
- Includes a state-of-the-art pattern collection.
- Fast loading of large patterns.
- Paste in patterns from the clipboard.
- Unlimited undo/redo.
- Unbounded zooming out for astronomical patterns.
- Auto fit option keeps a generating pattern within view.
- Full screen option (no menu/status/tool/scroll bars).
- Supports multiple layers, including cloned layers.
- HTML-based help with an integrated Life Lexicon.
- Scriptable via Perl or Python.
- User-configurable keyboard shortcuts.
- Free, open source and cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).
- We also provide bgolly, a GUI-less version.

The Golly application can be installed anywhere you like, but make
sure you move the whole folder because the various subfolders must
be kept with the application.

The latest information is available at the Golly web site:

Now go forth and generate!
