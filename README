Welcome to Golly, a Game of Life simulator.

***** NOTE THAT THIS IS A BETA RELEASE *****

Features:

- Run bigger patterns, faster and further than ever before!
- Unbounded universe (even larger than 2^32 on a side).
- Fast, memory-efficient conventional algorithm.
- Use hashing to see large patterns evolve at huge time scales.
- Responsive even while generating or garbage collecting.
- Reads RLE, Life 1.05/1.06, and macrocell formats.
- Paste in patterns from the clipboard.
- Fast loading of large patterns.
- Unbounded zooming out for astronomical patterns.
- Auto fit option keeps your pattern sized to the window.
- Full screen option (no menu/status/tool/scroll bars).
- HTML-based help system.
- Free, open source and cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac).

And this is just the beginning. :)

The Golly application can be installed anywhere you like, but
make sure you move the whole folder because the Help subfolder
must be kept with the application.

To run Golly, just click on the application icon or type golly
on the command line.  See the Help menu for all the details.

Please visit the Golly web site for the latest information:

Now go forth and generate!
