- Fast loading of large patterns.
- Paste in patterns from the clipboard.
- Unbounded zooming out for astronomical patterns.
- Auto fit option keeps your pattern sized to the window.

- HTML-based help with integrated Life Lexicon.
- Scriptable via Python.
- Free, open source and cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux).

The Golly application can be installed anywhere you like, but
make sure you move the whole folder because the Help subfolder
must be kept with the application.

To run Golly, just click on the application icon or type golly
on the command line.  See the Help menu for all the details.

Now go forth and generate!
