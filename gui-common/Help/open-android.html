<h2>Open Screen</h2>
    
<p>
The Open screen lets you select a pattern to load from a number of different sources:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The large collection of patterns supplied with the app.
<li> The most recently opened patterns (from newest to oldest).
<li> Patterns you have saved.
<li> Patterns you have downloaded.
</ul>

<p>
In the last two cases you have the option of deleting a file
by tapping on the "DELETE" link.

<p>
Text files stored in Documents have an "EDIT" link which will display the
file's contents and let you edit it.  The resulting view has a Save button
which lets you save any changes to the original file or to a new file.
Text files supplied with the app have a "READ" link so you can view the file
(editing is disabled and there is no Save button).

<p>
When you tap on a link to a pattern file, Golly will load the pattern
and automatically switch to the Golly screen.
(However, if you tap on a link to a zip file, Golly will switch to
the Help screen and display its contents there.)
