<h2>Hints and Tips</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Displaying the population count can cause a significant slow-down when
generating large patterns, especially when using HashLife.
If you want to generate at maximum speed then hit the Full Screen button.
</li>
<li>
Editing operations are fastest in QuickLife.
</li>
<li>
Pasting large, sparse patterns is much faster when using OR mode,
or if the current pattern is empty,
or if the paste image is completely outside the current pattern edges.
</li>
<li>
After making a selection you can change its size by dragging inside
the selection near a corner or edge, or move the selection by dragging
near the middle.
</li>
</ul>
