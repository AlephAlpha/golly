<h2>Credits</h2>

<h3>The pioneers</h3>

<p>
First and foremost, a big thanks to John Conway for creating the Game of Life,
and to Martin Gardner for popularizing the topic in his Scientific American
column.

<h3>The programmers</h3>

<p>
Tom Rokicki wrote most of the complicated stuff.
Golly is essentially the merging of two of Tom's programs (hlife and qlife).
The HashLife algorithm is based on an idea by Bill Gosper.
The QuickLife algorithm uses some ideas from Alan Hensel.
David Eppstein provided the idea on how to emulate B0 rules.

<p>
Andrew Trevorrow wrote the cross-platform GUI code for the desktop version
of Golly using <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.
Much thanks to Julian Smart and all the other wxWidgets developers.
Andrew also wrote the GUI code for the iOS, Android and Web versions
of Golly.

<!--
<p>
Golly's scripting capabilities were inspired by the generosity and efforts of
Eugene Langvagen (author of <a href="http://plife.sourceforge.net/">PLife</a>),
Larry Wall (creator of <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>)
and Guido van Rossum (creator of <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>).
-->

<p>
Tim Hutton wrote the RuleTable algorithm (now merged into the RuleLoader algorithm)
and created the excellent
<a href="http://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository">Rule Table Repository</a>.

<p>
Various code improvements have been contributed by Dave Greene, Jason Summers,
Maks Verver, Robert Munafo, Chris Rowett and Brenton Bostick.

<p>
Thanks to Nathaniel Johnston for creating the brilliant
<a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">LifeWiki</a>
and for making its patterns available to Golly users via an
<a href="get:http://www.conwaylife.com/golly.html">online archive</a>.
