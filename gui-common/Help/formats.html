<a name="rle"></a>
<h3>Extended RLE format</h3>

<p>
Golly prefers to store patterns and pattern fragments in a simple
concise textual format we call "Extended RLE" (it's a modified version
of the RLE format created by Dave Buckingham).  The data is run-length
encoded which works well for sparse patterns while still being easy to
interpret (either by a machine or by a person).  The format permits
retention of the most critical data:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The cell configuration; ie. which cells have what values.
<li> The transition rule to be applied.
<li> Any comments or description.
<li> The generation count.
<li> The absolute position on the screen.
</ul>

<p>
Golly uses this format for internal cuts and pastes, which makes it
very convenient to move cell configurations to and from text files.
For instance, the r-pentomino is represented as

<p>
<dd><tt>x = 3, y = 3, rule = B3/S23</tt></dd>
<dd><tt>b2o$2o$bo!</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
Pattern data in this format can be cut from a browser or email window
and pasted directly into Golly.

<p>
RLE data is indicated by a file whose first non-comment line starts
with "x".  A comment line is either a blank line or a line beginning
with "#".  The line starting with "x" gives the dimensions of the
pattern and usually the rule, and has the following format:

<p>
<dd><tt>x = <i>width</i>, y = <i>height</i>, rule = <i>rule</i></tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
where <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are the dimensions of the pattern
and <i>rule</i> is the rule to be applied.
Whitespace can be inserted at any point in this line
except at the beginning or where it would split a token.
The dimension data is ignored when Golly loads a pattern, so it need
not be accurate, but it is <em>not</em> ignored when Golly pastes a pattern;
it is used as the boundary of what to paste, so it may be larger or
smaller than the smallest rectangle enclosing all live cells.

<p>
Any line that is not blank, or does not start with a "#" or "x " or
"x=" is treated as run-length encoded pattern data.  The data is
ordered a row at a time from top to bottom, and each row is ordered
left to right.  A "$" represents the end of each row and an optional
"!" represents the end of the pattern.

<p>
For two-state rules, a "b" represents an off cell, and a "o"
represents an on cell.  For rules with more than two states, a "."
represents a zero state; states 1..24 are represented by "A".."X",
states 25..48 by "pA".."pX", states 49..72 by "qA".."qZ", and on up to
states 241..255 represented by "yA".."yO".  The pattern reader is
flexible and will permit "b" and "." interchangeably and "o" and "A"
interchangeably.

<p>
Any data value or row terminator can be immediately preceded with an
integer indicating a repetition count.  Thus, "3o" and "ooo"
both represent a sequence of three on cells, and "5$" means finish the
current row and insert four blank rows, and start at the left side of
the row after that.

<p>
The pattern writer attempts to keep lines about 70 characters long for
convenience when sharing patterns or storing them in text files, but the
reader will accept much longer lines.

<p>
Comment lines with a specific format will be added at the start of the file
to convey extra information.
These comment lines start with "#CXRLE" and contain keyword/value pairs.
The keywords currently supported are "Pos", which denotes the absolute
position of the upper left cell (which may be on or off),
and "Gen", which denotes the generation count.  For instance,

<p>
<dd><tt>#CXRLE Pos=0,-1377 Gen=3480106827776</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
indicates that the upper left corner of the enclosing rectange is at
an X coordinate of 0 and a Y coordinate of -1377, and that the
pattern stored is at generation 3,480,106,827,776.

<p>
All comment lines that occur at the top or bottom of the file
are treated as information lines and are displayed in a modal view
when you tap the Info button in the Pattern tab's bottom toolbar.
Any comment lines interspersed with the pattern data will not be
displayed.


<a name="mc"></a>
<h3>Macrocell format</h3>

<p>
The size of an Extended RLE file is frequently proportional to the
number of cells it contains, yet Golly supports universes that can
contain trillions of cells or more, using hashlife-based algorithms.
The storage of these huge universes, for which Extended RLE is not
feasible, is done by essentially dumping the in-memory compressed
representation of the universe in "Macrocell format".  Since little
translation need be done between external and internal representation,
this format is also used to store backups of universes at certain
points in Golly's operation when using one of the hashlife-based
algorithms.

<p>
The macrocell format has two parts: the header, and the tree.  The
first portion of the file is the header; this contains the format
identifier, the rule, the generation count (if non-zero), and any
comments associated with this file.  The format identifier is a
line that starts with "[M2]" and contains the name and version of
the program used to write it:

<p>
<dd><tt>[M2] (golly 2.0)</tt></dd>

<p>
Following this is any comment lines, which are lines that begin with
'#'.  If the first two characters of a line are '#R', then the
remainder of the line (after intervening whitespace) is the rule for
the pattern.  If the first two characters are '#G', then the remainder
of the line is the current generation count.  Any other line starting
with a '#' is treated as an ordinary comment line.

<p>
Following the header is is a child-first textual representation of a
canonicalized quadtree.  Each line is either a leaf node, or a
non-leaf node.  For two-state algorithms, the leaf nodes contain an
8x8 pixel array in a simplified raster format, left-to-right, then
top-down, with "." representing an empty cell, "*" representing a live
cell, and "$" representing the end of line; empty cells at the end of
each row are suppressed.  No whitespace is permitted; lines
representing leaf nodes for two-state algorithms are recognized
because they start with ".", "*", or "$".  A sample leaf node
containing a glider is:

<p>
<dd><tt>$$..*$...*$.***$$$$</tt></dd>

<p>
For algorithms with more than two states, leaf nodes represent a
two-by-two square of the universe.  They contain five integers
separated by single spaces; the first integer is 1, and the next
four are the state values for the northwest, northeast,
southwest, and southeast values of the square.

<p>
Nodes with children are represented by lines with five integers.  The
first integer is the logarithm base 2 of the size of the square this
node representes; for two-state patterns, this must be 4 or larger;
for multi-state patterns, this must be 2 or larger.  The next four
values are the node numbers of the northwest, northeast, southwest,
and southeast child nodes.  Each of these child nodes must be the
appropriate size; that is, a square one fourth the area of the current
node.

<p>
All nodes, both leaf and non-leaf, are numbered in the order they
occur in the file, starting with 1.  No node number can point to a
node that has yet been defined.  The special node number "0" is
used to represent all squares that have no live cells.

<p>
The total universe represented by a macrocell file is that of the last
node in the file (the root node), which also must be the single node
with the largest size.  By convention, the upper left cell of the
southeast child of the root node is at coordinate position (x=0,y=1).

<p>
Macrocell files saved from two-state algorithms and from multi-state
algorithms are not compatible.


<p><a name="rule"></a>
<font size=+1><b>Rule format</b></font>

<p>
A .rule file contains all the information about a rule: its name, documentation,
table/tree data (used by the RuleLoader algorithm), and any color/icon information.
The .rule format is textual and consists of one or more sections.
Each section starts with a line of the form @XXX... where X is an uppercase letter.
If there is more than one section with the same name then only the first one is used.
Any unrecognized sections are silently ignored (this will allow us to add new sections
in the future without breaking old versions of Golly).

<p>
The currently recognized sections are described below.  You might like to refer to
<a href="edit:Rules/WireWorld.rule">WireWorld.rule</a> while reading about
each section.


<p><a name="rulename"></a>
<font size=+1><b>@RULE</b></font>

<p>
This is the only mandatory section.  The first line of a .rule must start with
@RULE followed by a space and then the rule name.  For example:

<p>
<dd><tt>@RULE WireWorld</tt></dd>
</p>

<p>
The supplied rule name must match exactly the name of the .rule file.
This helps Golly to avoid problems that can occur on case-sensitive file systems.
When naming a new rule it's best to stick to the following conventions,
especially if you'd like to share the .rule file with other Golly users:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Please capitalize all rule names and create files like Foo.rule rather
than foo.rule.  This helps to emphasize that rule names are important,
especially on case-sensitive file systems.  If the rule "foo" is
specified inside a .rle or .mc file then Golly won't be able to find
Foo.rule on a case-sensitive system like Linux.
<li>
To allow for possible future extensions in the way Golly handles rule names,
it's best to use only letters and digits.
Hyphens and underscores are also okay if you need some sort of separator.
Hyphens can allow a set of related rules to share colors and/or icons
(see <a href="#share">below</a>).
Note in particular that spaces and colons must not be used.
</ul>

<p>
After the @RULE line and before the next section (or end of file) you can
include any amount of arbitrary text, so this is the place to include a
description of the rule or any other documentation.
If the .rule file has a @TREE section then this is a good place to put
the Python transition function that was used to create the tree data.


<p><a name="table"></a>
<font size=+1><b>@TABLE</b></font>

<p>
This section is optional.  If present, it contains a transition table
that can be loaded by the RuleLoader algorithm.
The contents of this section is identical to the contents of a .table file.
A detailed specification of the table format is available
<a href="http://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository/wiki/TheFormat">here</a>.
This is a simple example:

<dd><table border=0><pre>
# Signals (2/3) pass alongside a wire (1):
n_states:4
neighborhood:vonNeumann
symmetries:rotate4
var a={2,3}
var b={2,3}
var c={2,3}
a,0,b,1,c,b</pre></table></dd>

<p>
Empty lines and anything following the hash symbol "#" are ignored.
The following descriptors must appear before other content:

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>n_states:</b> specifies the number of states in the CA
(from 0 to n_states-1 inclusive).</li>

<li><b>neighborhood:</b> specifies the cell neighborhood for
the CA update step. Must be one of: <b>vonNeumann</b>, <b>Moore</b>,
<b>hexagonal</b>, <b>oneDimensional</b>.</li> Other neighborhoods are
supported through emulation, using
<a href="open:Scripts/Python/Rule-Generators/RuleTableToTree.py">RuleTableToTree.py</a>,
see the <a href="http://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository/wiki/RoadMap">RoadMap</a>
for a full list.

<li><b>symmetries:</b> can be <b>none</b>, <b>permute</b> or one of the symmetries
supported for the neighborhood you have chosen. For a full list, see the
<a href="http://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository/wiki/RoadMap">RoadMap</a>.
</ul>

<p>
After the descriptors comes the variables and transitions.  Each variable line
should follow the form given in the above example to list the states.
Variables should appear before the first transition that uses them.
Variables can be used inside later variables.

<p>
Transition lines should have states or variables separated by commas.
If there are no variables and <b>n_states</b> is less than 11 then the commas
can be omitted. Only one transition (or variable) should appear on each line.
Inputs are listed in the order C,N,E,S,W,C' for the von Neumann neighborhood,
C,N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,C' for the Moore neighborhood, C,N,E,SE,S,W,NW,C' for the
hexagonal neighborhood, and C,W,E,C' for the oneDimensional neighborhood.

<p>
Where the same variable appears more than once in a transition, it stands
for the same state each time. For example, the transition in the example above
expands to the following:
20212->2, 20213->2, 20312->3, 20313->3,
30212->2, 30213->2, 30312->3, 30313->3, and
all 90-degree rotations of those (because of the <b>rotate4</b> symmetry).

<p>A transition can have a variable as its output
(C') if that variable appears more than once in the transition (as in the example above),
so that it has a definite value.

<p>
Rule tables usually don't specify every possible set of inputs. For those
not listed, the central cell remains unchanged.

<p>
Transition rules are checked in the order given &mdash; the first rule that
matches is applied. If you want, you can write rules in the form of general
cases and exceptions, as long as the exceptions appear first.

<p>
(This form of CA rule table representation was inspired by that in Gianluca Tempesti's
PhD thesis:
<a href="http://lslwww.epfl.ch/pages/embryonics/thesis/AppendixA.html">http://lslwww.epfl.ch/pages/embryonics/thesis/AppendixA.html</a>.)

<p>
To share your rule tables with others, you can archive them at the public
<a href="http://github.com/GollyGang/ruletablerepository">Rule Table Repository</a>.


<p><a name="tree"></a>
<font size=+1><b>@TREE</b></font>

<p>
This section is optional.  If present, it contains a rule tree
that can be loaded by the RuleLoader algorithm.
(If the .rule file also contains a @TABLE section, RuleLoader will
use the first one it finds.)
The contents of this section is identical to the contents of a .tree file.

<p>
Essentially, the tree format allows you
to add your own rules to Golly without needing to know how to
recompile Golly and without dealing with the intricacies of external
libraries; it generates relatively compact files, and the data
structure is designed for very fast execution.

<p>
A rule tree is nothing more than a complete transition table for a
rule, expressed in a compressed, canonicalized tree format.  For an n
state rule, each tree node has n children; each child is either
another tree node or a next state value.  To look up a function of m
variables, each of which is a state value, you start at the root node
and select the child node corresponding to the value of the first
variable.  From that node, you select the child node corresponding to
the value of the second variable, and so on.  When you finally look up
the value of the final variable in the last node, the result value is
the actual next state value, rather than another node.

<p>
The tree format has fixed the order of variables used for these
lookups.  For a four-neighbor rule, the order is always north, west,
east, south, center; for an eight-neighbor rule, the order is always
northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast, north, west, east, south,
center.

<p>
Without compression, for an n-state rule, there would be a total of
1+n+n^2+n^3+n^4 nodes for a four-neighbor rule, and 1+n+...+n^8 for an
eight-neighbor rule; this could quickly get unmanageable.  Almost all
rules show significant redundancy, with identical rows in the
transition table, and identical nodes in the rule tree.  To compress
this tree, all we do is merge identical nodes, from the bottom up.
This can be done explicitly as we construct the tree from a transition
function (see Rules/TreeGenerators/RuleTreeGen.java) or symbolically
as we evaluate a more expressive format.

<p>
The tree format itself is simple, and has similarities to the
macrocell format.  It is not intended for human authorship or
consumption.  The tree format has two parts: a header, and the
rule tree itself.  The header consists of comments (lines starting
with a "#") that are ignored, and three required parameter values
that must be defined before the first tree node.  These values are
defined, one per line, starting with the parameter name, then an
equals sign, and finally an integer value.  The three parameters
are num_states, which must be in the range 2..256 inclusive,
num_neighbors, which must be 4 or 8, and num_nodes, which must
match the number of node lines.

<p>
The tree is represented by a sequence of node lines.  Each node line
consists of exactly num_states integers separated by single spaces.
The first integer of each node line is the depth of that node, which
must range from 1..num_neighbors+1.  The remaining integers for nodes
of depth one are state values.  The remaining integers for nodes of
depth greater than one are node numbers.  Nodes are numbered in the
order they appear in the file, starting with zero; each node must be
defined before its node number is used.  The root node, which must
be the single node at depth num_neighbors+1, must be the last node
defined in the file.


<p><a name="colors"></a>
<font size=+1><b>@COLORS</b></font>

<p>
This section is optional and can be used to specify the RGB colors for
one or more states using lines with 4 numbers, like these:

<dd><table border=0><pre>
0  48  48  48   dark gray
1   0 128 255   light blue
2 255 255 255   white
3 255 128   0   orange</pre></table></dd>

<p>
Golly silently ignores any states that are invalid for the rule.
To specify a color gradient for all live states (all states except 0)
you can use a line with 6 numbers, like this:

<dd><table border=0><pre>
0 0 255  255 0 0   blue to red</pre></table></dd>

<p>
In both cases, any text after the final number on each line is ignored.
Blank lines or lines starting with "#" are also ignored.

<p>
Note that a .rule file is loaded <i>after</i> switching to the current
algorithm's default color scheme, so you have the choice of completely
changing all the default colors, or only changing some of them.


<p><a name="icons"></a>
<font size=+1><b>@ICONS</b></font>

<p>
This section is optional and can be used to override the default icons
displayed for this rule (when Golly is in icon mode).


<p><a name="xpm"></a>
<font size=+1><b>Specifying icons using XPM</b></font>

<p>
Icon bitmaps can be specified using a simple subset of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap">XPM</a> format.
Here's a small example that describes two 7x7 icons suitable for a
3-state rule (icons are never used for state 0):

<dd><table border=0><pre>
XPM
/* width height num_colors chars_per_pixel */
"7 14 2 1"
/* colors */
". c #000000"
"A c #FFFFFF"
/* icon for state 1 */
"A......"
".A....."
"..A...."
"...A..."
"....A.."
".....A."
"......A"
/* icon for state 2 */
"......A"
".....A."
"....A.."
"...A..."
"..A...."
".A....."
"A......"</pre></table></dd>

<p>
Any blank lines or lines starting with "#" or "/" are ignored.
A line with XPM by itself indicates the start of a set of icon bitmaps at
a particular size.  The @ICONS section can contain any number of XPM
subsections, and their order is not important.
Three different icon sizes are currently supported: 7x7, 15x15 and 31x31
(for displaying at scales 1:8, 1:16 and 1:32 respectively).
Any missing icon sizes will be created automatically by scaling a
supplied size.  Scaled icons can look rather ugly, so if you want
good looking icons it's best to supply all three sizes.

<p>
After seeing an XPM line, Golly then looks for lines containing strings
delimited by double quotes.  The first double quote must be at the start
of the line (any text after the second double quote is ignored).
The first string contains crucial header information in the form of
4 positive integers:

<p>
<ul>
<li>
The 1st number is the bitmap's width which also defines the icon size.
If it is not 7, 15 or 31 then Golly simply ignores the rest of the XPM data.
(This provides upward compatibility if we ever decide to support more sizes.)
<li>
The 2nd number is the bitmap's height.  This must be an integer multiple
of the width &mdash; the number of icons is the height divided by the width.
<li>
The 3rd number is the total number of different colors used in the bitmap.
After the first string comes the strings that specify each color.
<li>
The 4th number is the number of characters used to specify each pixel
and must be 1 or 2.  After the color strings comes the strings with the
pixel data for each row of the bitmap.  Each such string should contain
width &times; chars_per_pixel characters.
</ul>

<p>
The total number of strings after the XPM line should be 1 + num_colors + height.
You'll get an error message if there aren't enough strings.
Any extra strings are ignored.

<p>
The 1st icon specified is for state 1, the 2nd is for state 2, etc.
If the number of icons supplied is fewer than the number of live states
then the last icon is automatically duplicated.  If there are more icons
than required then the extra icons are simply ignored.


<p><a name="grayscale"></a>
<font size=+1><b>Grayscale icons or multi-color icons</b></font>

<p>
Golly recognizes two types of icons: grayscale or multi-color.
Grayscale icons only use shades of gray (including black and white), as in
the above example.  Any black areas will be transparent; ie. those pixels
will be replaced by the color for state 0.  White pixels will be replaced
by the color for the cell's current state.  Gray pixels are used to do
anti-aliasing; ie. the darker the gray the greater the transparency.
Using grayscale icons minimizes the amount of XPM data needed to describe
a set of icons, especially if the icons use the same shape for each state
(as in <a href="edit:Rules/WireWorld.rule">WireWorld.rule</a>).

<p>
If a set of icons contains at least one color that isn't a shade of gray
(including black or white) then the icons are said to be multi-colored.
Any black pixels are still converted to the state 0 color, but non-black
pixels are displayed without doing any substitutions.

<p>
If you want to use multi-colored icons then you'll probably want a @COLORS
section as well so that the non-icon colors match the icon colors as closely
as possible.  For example, if the icon for state 1 consists of red and blue
triangles then it would be best to set the color of state 1 to purple in
the @COLORS section.  This minimizes "color shock" when switching between
icon and non-icon display mode.


<p><a name="builtin"></a>
<font size=+1><b>Requesting built-in icons</b></font>

<p>
Instead of specifying icon bitmaps using XPM data, you might prefer to use
Golly's built-in grayscale icons by supplying one of the following words
on a line by itself:

<p>
<ul>
<li> <b>circles</b> &mdash; circular icons
     (normally used for Moore neighborhood rules).
<li> <b>diamonds</b> &mdash; diamond-shaped icons
     (normally used for von Neumann neighborhood rules).
<li> <b>hexagons</b> &mdash; hexagonal icons
     (normally used for hexagonal neighborhood rules).
<li> <b>triangles</b> &mdash; triangular icons
     (only suitable for a 4-state rule that is emulating a triangular neighborhood).
</ul>


<p><a name="find"></a>
<font size=+1><b>How Golly finds .rule files</b></font>

<p>
There are two situations where Golly needs to look for a .rule file:

<p>
1. If the RuleLoader algorithm is asked to switch to a rule called "Foo" then it first
looks for Foo.rule in Documents/Rules/.
If not found, or if Foo.rule has no @TABLE or @TREE section, it will then look
for Foo.rule in the supplied Rules folder.  If Foo.rule doesn't exist then it will
use the same search procedure to look for Foo.table, then Foo.tree.

<p>
2. After switching to a new rule (not necessarily using RuleLoader), Golly needs
to look for color and/or icon information specific to that rule.  A similar search procedure
to the one above is used again, where this time Golly looks for any @COLORS and/or @ICONS
sections in Foo.rule.  (Unlike the above search, if Foo.rule is found in Documents/Rules/ but
doesn't have any color/icon info then Golly will <i>not</i> look for Foo.rule in the
supplied Rules folder.)


<p><a name="share"></a>
<font size=+1><b>Related rules can share colors and/or icons</b></font>

<p>
If <i>rulename</i>.rule is missing either the @COLORS or @ICONS section,
Golly checks to see if <i>rulename</i> contains a hyphen.
If it does then it looks for the missing color/icon data in another .rule file
called <i>prefix</i>-shared.rule where <i>prefix</i> consists of all the
characters before the <i>final</i> hyphen.
(As in the above searches, it looks in Documents/Rules/ first,
then in the supplied Rules folder.)
This allows related rules to share a single source of colors and/or icons. 

<p>
For example, suppose you have a set of related rules in files called Foo-1.rule, Foo-2.rule, etc.
If you want all these rules to use the same colors then create a file called Foo-shared.rule:

<dd><table border=0><pre>
@RULE Foo-shared
This file contains the colors shared by Foo-* rules.

@TABLE
n_states:3
neighborhood:Moore
symmetries:none
# do nothing

@COLORS
0 0 0 0     black
1 255 0 0   red
2 0 0 255   blue</pre></table></dd>

<p>
Note that a shared .rule file should contain a valid @TABLE section with an
appropriate value for n_states (the neighborhood setting doesn't really matter,
as long as it's legal).  This allows the RuleLoader algorithm to load it.

<font size=+1><b>How to override a supplied or built-in rule</b></font>

<p>
The search procedure described above makes it easy to override a supplied .rule file,
either completely or partially.  For example, if you want to override the colors and icons
used in the supplied WireWorld.rule then you can create a file with the same name in
Documents/Rules/.  Its contents might look like this:

<dd><table border=0><pre>
@RULE WireWorld

@COLORS
0 0 0 0               black background
0 255 0   255 255 0   live states fade from green to yellow

@ICONS
diamonds</pre></table></dd>

<p>
It's also possible to override a built-in rule (ie. a rule recognized by an algorithm other than
RuleLoader).  A built-in rule name can contain characters not allowed in file names ("/" and "\"),
so Golly will substitute those characters with underscores when looking for the corresponding
.rule file. For example, if you want to change the colors and/or icons for Life (B3/S23)
then you'll need to create a file called B3_S23.rule.  This example uses a multi-colored icon
to show a blue sphere on a white background:

<dd><table border=0><pre>
@RULE B3_S23

Override the default colors and icons for Life (B3/S23).

@COLORS

0 255 255 255   white (matches icon background below)
1 54 54 194     dark blue (average color of icon below)

@ICONS

# 7x7 and 15x15 icons will be created by scaling down this 31x31 icon:

<font size=+1><b>The easy way to install a new .rule file</b></font>

<p>
Golly provides a quick and easy way to create a new .rule file in the right place.
Simply copy the rule contents to the clipboard, then tap the Paste button.
If the first line of the clipboard starts with "@RULE <i>rulename</i>" then Golly will
save the text as Documents/Rules/<i>rulename</i>.rule and switch to that rule.


<p><a name="deprecated"></a>
<font size=+1><b>Deprecated files (.table, .tree)</b></font>

<p>
Golly still supports files with extensions of .table or .tree, but their use is discouraged.
When Golly opens a .zip file containing .table/tree files it will automatically
convert them into .rule files, but only if the zip file has no .rule files.
Any existing .rule files are overwritten (in case the zip file contents have changed).

<p>
Note that files with extensions of .colors or .icons are no longer supported and are simply
ignored.  The .rule format can be used to specify color and/or icon information
via the @COLORS and @ICONS sections, as described above.


<a name="zip"></a>
<h3>Zip files</h3>

<p>
Golly can open a standard zip file and display its contents in the Help tab.
It does this by building a temporary HTML file with
special <a href="help.html#links"><b>unzip</b></a> links to each included file.
Any .rule files in the zip file are automatically extracted and installed into
Documents/Rules/.

<!-- scripts not currently supported
<p>
For an example of a zip file, open
<a href="open:Patterns/WireWorld/Langtons-ant.zip">Langtons-ant.zip</a>
from the supplied WireWorld folder.  This zip file contains a pattern file
and a simple Python script that sets up a nicer initial view and step size.
-->

<p>
A number of pattern collections in the form of zip files can be downloaded
from the <a href="archives.html">online archives</a>.
