</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 1.1 (released June 2013)</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li> This version introduces a new rule format.  A file in the new format has a .rule
     extension and contains all the information about the rule: its name, description,
     table/tree data, and any color/icon information.  More details can be found
     <a href="formats.html#rule">here</a>.
<li> The RuleTable and RuleTree algorithms have been replaced by a new algorithm
     called RuleLoader.
<li> If the Paste button sees clipboard text starting with "@RULE rulename" then it will
     save the text as Documents/Rules/rulename.rule and switch to that rule.
<li> When the Rule dialog is switched to the RuleLoader algorithm it will display links
     to all the .rule files in Documents/Rules/ and to the supplied .rule files.
     Any deprecated files (.table or .tree or .colors or .icons) are automatically
     converted to .rule files and then deleted.
<li> Icons can be displayed at scales 1:8, 1:16 and 1:32 by turning on the "Show icons"
     option in either the Settings tab or the Pattern tab's state picker window.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause the Undo/Redo buttons to be incorrectly
     enabled/disabled after tapping STOP.
<li> The Open tab has READ and EDIT links that let you display or change the contents
     of pattern files.  Only files stored in the Documents folder can be edited.
<li> After tapping on a DELETE link you now get a warning dialog asking if you
     really want to delete the corresponding file.
<li> The size of text in the Help tab has been increased.
<li> Added support for file sharing using iTunes.
     More details <a href="open.html#sharing">here</a>.
