/*
 *   Into instances of this node structure is where almost all of the
 *   memory allocated by this program goes.  Thus, it is imperative we
 *   keep it as small as possible so we can explore patterns as large
 *   and as deep as possible.
 *
 *   But first, how does this program even work?  Well, there are
 *   two major tricks that are used.
 *
 *   The first trick is to represent the 2D space `symbolically'
 *   (in the sense that a binary decision diagram is a symbolic
 *   representation of a boolean predicate).  This can be thought
 *   of as a sort of compression.  We break up space into a grid of
 *   squares, each containing 8x8 cells.  And we `canonicalize'
 *   each square; that is, all the squares with no cells set are
 *   represented by a single actual instance of an empty square;
 *   all squares with only the upper-left-most cell set are
 *   represented by yet another instance, and so on.  A single pointer
 *   to the single instance of each square takes less space than
 *   representing the actual cell bits themselves.
 *
 *   Where do we store these pointers?  At first, one might envision
 *   a large two-dimensional array of pointers, each one pointing
 *   to one of the square instances.  But instead, we group the
 *   squares (we'll call them 8-squares) into larger squares 16
 *   cells on a side; these are 16-squares.  Each 16-square contains
 *   four 8-squares, so each 16-square is represented by four
 *   pointers, each to an 8-square.  And we canonicalize these as
 *   well, so for a particular set of values for a 16 by 16 array
 *   of cells, we'll only have a single 16-square.
 *
 *   And so on up; we canonicalize 32-squares out of 16-squares, and
 *   on up to some limit.  Now the limit need not be very large;
 *   having just 20 levels of nodes gives us a universe that is
 *   4 * 2**20 or about 4M cells on a side.  Having 100 levels of
 *   nodes (easily within the limits of this program) gives us a
 *   universe that is 4 * 2**100 or about 5E30 cells on a side.
 *   I've run universes that expand well beyond 1E50 on a side with
 *   this program.
 *
 *   [A nice thing about this representation is that there are no
 *   coordinate values anywhere, which means that there are no
 *   limits to the coordinate values or complex multidimensional
 *   arithmetic needed.]
 *
 *   [Note that this structure so far is very similar to the octtrees
 *   used in 3D simulation and rendering programs.  It's different,
 *   however, in that we canonicalize the nodes, and also, of course,
 *   in that it is 2D rather than 3D.]
 *
 *   I mentioned there were two tricks, and that's only the first.
 *   The second trick is to cache the `results' of the LIFE calculation,
 *   but in a way that looks ahead farther in time as you go higher
 *   in the tree, much like the tree nodes themselves scan larger
 *   distances in space.  This trick is just a little subtle, but it
 *   is where the bulk of the power of the program comes from.
 *
 *   Consider once again the 8-squares.  We want to cache the result
 *   of executing LIFE on that area.  We could cache the result of
 *   looking ahead just one generation; that would yield a 6x6 square.
 *   (Note that we cannot calculate an 8-square, because we are
 *   using the single instance of the 8-square to represent all the
 *   different places that 8x8 arrangement occurs, and those different
 *   places might be surrounded by different border cells.  But we
 *   can say for sure that the central 6-square will evolve in a
 *   unique way in the next generation.)
 *
 *   We could also calculate the 4-square that is two generations
 *   hence, and the 3-square that is three generations hence, and
 *   the 2-square that is four generations hence.  We choose the
 *   4-square that is two generations hence; why will be clear in
 *   a moment.
 *
 *   Now let's consider the 16-square.  We would like to look farther
 *   ahead for this square (if we always only looked two generations
 *   ahead, our runtime would be at *least* linear in the number of
 *   generations, and we want to beat that.)  So let's look 4 generations
 *   ahead, and cache the resulting 8-square.  So we do.
 *
 *   Where do we cache the results?  Well, we cache the results in the
 *   same node structure we are using to store the pointers to the
 *   smaller squares themselves.  And since we're hashing them all
 *   together, we want a next pointer for the hash chain.  Put all of
 *   this together, and you get the following structure for the 16-squares
 *   and larger:
 */
struct node {
   node *next ;              /* hash link */
   node *nw, *ne, *sw, *se ; /* constant; nw != 0 means nonleaf */
   node *res ;               /* cache */
} ;
/*
 *   For the 8-squares, we do not have `children', we have actual data
 *   values.  We still break up the 8-square into 4-squares, but the
 *   4-squares only have 16 cells in them, so we represent them directly
 *   by an unsigned short (in this case, the direct value itself takes
 *   less memory than the pointer we might replace it with).
 *
 *   One minor trick about the following structure.  We did lie above
 *   somewhat; sometimes the struct node * points to an actual struct
 *   node, and sometimes it points to a struct leaf.  So we need a way
 *   to tell if the thing we are pointing at is a node or a leaf.  We
 *   could add another bit to the node structure, but this would grow
 *   it, and we want it to stay as small as possible.  Now, notice
 *   that, in all valid struct nodes, all four pointers (nw, ne, sw,
 *   and se) must contain a live non-zero value.  We simply ensure
 *   that the struct leaf contains a zero where the first (nw) pointer
 *   field would be in a struct node.
 *
 *   Each short represents a 4-square in normal, left-to-right then top-down
 *   order from the most significant bit.  So bit 0x8000 is the upper
 *   left (or northwest) bit, and bit 0x1000 is the upper right bit, and
 *   so on.
