<font size=-1>

<p>
NOTE: [key] next to a menu item indicates a keyboard shortcut.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Cut</b></font>

<p>
Copies the pattern in the current selection to the clipboard
(in RLE format) and then kills all cells in the selection.
[In the X11 app the pattern is saved in a file called ".golly_clipboard".]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Copy</b></font>

<p>
Copies the pattern in the current selection to the clipboard.
The clipboard data is in RLE format.
[In the X11 app the pattern is saved in a file called ".golly_clipboard".]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Clear</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[delete]

<p>
Kills all cells in the current selection.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Clear Outside</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[shift-delete]

<p>
Kills all cells outside the current selection.
This is often the quickest way to delete escaping gliders.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[v]

<p>
Pastes a pattern stored in the clipboard into the existing pattern.
Any rule information in the clipboard pattern is ignored.
After selecting this item you'll be asked to click where you want
the paste to occur.
Before clicking you can use keyboard shortcuts to scroll,
change scale, etc.  You can also type "M" to change the paste mode
or "L" to change the paste location (see below).
To cancel the paste, just click anywhere outside the view area
or hit the escape key.

<p>
The <a href="refs.html">References</a> section has links to
a number of good sources for clipboard patterns.
[There is currently no global clipboard support in the X11 version; you
can only paste a pattern that has been saved by the Cut/Copy commands.]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste Mode</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you choose the logical function used when pasting in
a clipboard pattern.  The choices are Copy, Or and Xor.
Typing "M" will cycle through all these modes, even after selecting
the Paste command.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste Location</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you choose the location of the cursor within the
paste rectangle that appears after selecting the Paste command.
You can choose any corner or the middle of the rectangle.
Typing "L" will cycle through all possible locations, even after
selecting the Paste command.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Paste to Selection</b></font>

<p>
Pastes a clipboard pattern into the current selection, but only if it will fit.
The paste always occurs at the top left corner of the selection.
This command can be used as a quick check to see if the pattern in the
clipboard matches the pattern in the selection -- if Xor paste mode is used
then all the resulting cells will be dead if the patterns match.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Select All</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[a]

<p>
Selects the entire pattern, assuming there are one or more live cells.
If there are no live cells then any existing selection is removed.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Remove Selection</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[k]

<p>
Removes the current selection (without changing any cell states).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Cursor Mode</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you choose a cursor mode for various editing operations:
drawing cells, selecting cells, moving the view, and zooming into or out from
a clicked cell.
It's probably easier to use the corresponding buttons in the tool bar.
You can also type "c" to cycle through all the cursors, or press
the shift key to temporarily toggle the zoom in/out cursor.
