<p>
NOTE: [key] next to a menu item indicates a keyboard shortcut.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>New Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Creates a new, empty universe and switches to a large scale
ready for editing cells.
Use the Preferences dialog to set the scale (initially 1:16),
the cursor mode, and whether any selection should be removed.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Pattern...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up the standard file browser so you can select a pattern file.
Golly can read all the common pattern formats:
RLE, PC Life 1.05/1.06, and text patterns like "ooo...ooo".
It can also read patterns in a "macrocell" format which allows huge,
highly repetitive patterns to be stored in a very compact way.
Note that Golly automatically turns on the
<a href="control.html#hashing">Use Hashing</a>
option when it reads a macrocell file.
Such files usually have a .mc extension.

<p>
All the above formats are text based and can have DOS/Mac/Unix line endings,
or they can be compressed in a .gz file.

<p>
Use the Preferences dialog to set the cursor mode, and whether any
selection should be removed.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Clipboard</b></font>

<p>
Opens a pattern stored in the clipboard.
The <a href="refs.html">References</a> section has links to
a number of good sources for clipboard patterns.
[There is currently no global clipboard support in the X11 version; you can
only open a pattern that has been saved by the Edit menu's Cut/Copy commands.]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Recent</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you open a recently loaded pattern file.
The most recent file is always at the top.
The maximum number of files remembered is determined by a setting
(initially 20) which you can change in the Preferences dialog.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Save Pattern...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up the standard file saving dialog so you can save the current pattern
in RLE format (but only if all live cells are within coordinates of +/- 1 billion).
If the hashing option is on then you can also save the pattern in macrocell format.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Preferences...</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[,]

<p>
Opens the Preferences dialog so you can change various settings.
[On the Mac, this item is in the application menu.]
