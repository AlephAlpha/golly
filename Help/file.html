<p>
<font size=+1><b>New Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Creates a new, empty universe and switches to the maximum scale (1:16)
ready for editing cells.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Pattern...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up the standard file browser so you can select a pattern file.
Golly can read all the common pattern formats:
RLE, PC Life 1.05/1.06, and text patterns like "ooo...ooo".
It can also read patterns in a "macrocell" format which allows huge,
highly repetitive patterns to be stored in a very compact way.
Note that Golly automatically turns on the
<a href="control.html#hashing">Use Hashing</a>
option when it reads a macrocell file.
Such files usually have a .mc extension.

<p>
All the above formats are text based and can have DOS/Mac/Unix line endings,
or they can be compressed in a .gz file.
[The latter feature is not yet available in the Windows version.]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Open Clipboard</b></font>

<p>
Opens a pattern stored in the clipboard.
The <a href="refs.html">References</a> section has links to
a number of good sources for clipboard patterns.
[There is currently no global clipboard support in the X11 version; you can
only open a pattern that has been saved by the Edit menu's Cut/Copy commands.]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Save Pattern...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up the standard file saving dialog so you can save the current pattern.
If the hashing option is on then you can save the pattern in RLE format
(but only if all live cells are within coordinates of +/- 1 billion)
or in macrocell format.
