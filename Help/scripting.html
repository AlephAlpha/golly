<p>
TO BE DONE!!!

<p>
- Intro.

<p>
- Discuss some of the examples in the Scripts folder.
Some show how to automate Golly (eg. slide-show.py).
Some show how to extend Golly (eg. invert.py).
Some show how to construct complicated patterns (mention PLife).
Note that scripts don't have to use the glife package.

<p>
- Installing Python (not needed on Mac OS X).  Link to www.python.org.

<p>
- Describe each of Golly's scripting commands.

<p>
- Describe how Python errors are caught.

<p>
- Describe how to abort a running script.

<p>
- Note that the current working directory is temporarily changed to the location
of the selected script file.  Explain why.
