<title>Golly Help: Changes</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 1.2 (released !!!)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Added support for multiple layers.
     See the <a href="layer.html">Layer menu</a> help for details.
<li> Added <a href="scripting.html#layers">layer-related scripting commands</a>.
<li> Added smear.py to the Scripts folder to show how layers can be used.
<li> Added other useful scripting commands:
     <a href="scripting.html#exit">exit</a>,
     <a href="scripting.html#check">check</a> and
     <a href="scripting.html#note">note</a>.
<li> Clicked lexicon patterns are loaded into a separate "lexicon" layer
     (and the clipboard is no longer changed).
<li> Scrolling is optional if the pencil/cross/hand cursor is dragged outside
     the view window (see Preferences > Edit).
<li> The hand cursor no longer has a pointing finger.
<li> Linux/GTK app no longer does unnecessary buffered drawing.
<li> Reset and Use Hashing can be selected while a pattern is generating.
<li> Renamed Flip Up-Down to Flip Top-Bottom.
<li> Fixed a bug in the advance and evolve commands if using hashing with Wolfram rule.
<li> Fixed a delay bug.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 1.1 (released November 2006)</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Added Save Extended RLE option (initially ticked) to the File menu.
     An extended RLE file stores the pattern position and generation count
     (if > 0) so they can be restored when the file is loaded.
<li> Macrocell files also store the generation count if > 0.
<li> Non-extended RLE files are now loaded so that 0,0 is at the top left
     corner of the pattern rather than in the middle of the pattern.
<li> Golly can read BMP/GIF/PNG/TIFF files and paste bitmap data.
     All non-white pixels become live cells.
<li> Golly can read pattern files using David Bell's dblife format.
<li> Starting patterns are saved in a temporary file rather than in memory.
     This is much faster when hashing (saving a macrocell file is very quick).
<li> Random Fill is much faster in typical cases.
<li> Escape key can be used to stop generating.
<li> Numerous additions and updates to the pattern collection.
<li> Added fuse-watcher.py, metafier.py and shift.py to the Scripts folder.
<li> More mouse interaction is allowed while a script is running.
     A script can be aborted by clicking the stop button in the tool bar
     or by selecting Stop in the Control menu.
<li> Resizing the help window no longer changes the scroll position.
<li> Fixed a bug loading huge macrocell files.
<li> Fixed an obscure bug in the non-hashing algorithm.
<li> Path to Scripts folder is only added to Python's sys.path once.
<li> Fixed rect bug in Scripts/glife/__init__.py (thanks to Dan Hoey).
<li> Golly's code can be compiled with a Unicode build of wxWidgets.
</ul>

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Changes in version 1.0 (released June 2006)</b></font>

<li> Golly is available for Linux/GTK.
<li> Mac app is a Universal Binary (4 times faster on an Intel Mac).
<li> Added ability to change various colors via Preferences > Color.
     The Black on White option has been replaced by Swap Cell Colors.
<li> Increased the base step limit from 100 to 10,000.
<li> Added Show Hash Info option to the Control menu.
<li> Added Show Exact Numbers option to the View menu.
<li> Save Pattern preserves comments when writing to an existing file.
<li> Added tool bar buttons for toggling patterns and scripts.

<li> Renamed Flip Horizontally/Vertically to Flip Up-Down/Left-Right.
<li> Fixed disabled menu item bug after closing a modal dialog on Mac OS 10.4.
<li> Fixed a couple of rule-related bugs in the non-hashing algorithm.
<li> Fixed crash due to very long rule strings.
<li> Fixed paste positioning bugs at scale 1:2.

<li> Added Show Patterns and Change Folder to the File menu.
<li> Added a Preferences dialog to the File menu (app menu on Mac).

<li> The mouse wheel can be used for zooming, regardless of cursor mode.
