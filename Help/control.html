<title>Golly Help: Control Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
NOTE: [key] next to a menu item indicates a keyboard shortcut.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Go</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[g or return]

<p>
Starts generating the current pattern.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Stop</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[escape or return or space or .]

<p>
Stops generating the current pattern or aborts the current script.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Next</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[space]

<p>
Advances to the next generation.
Note that you can hit control-space to advance only the current selection,
or shift-space to advance everything outside the selection (in both cases
the generation count will not change).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Next Step</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[tab]

<p>
Advances to the next step.  The current step size is displayed in the status bar
and can be changed by the Faster/Slower items (see below).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Reset</b></font>

<p>
Restores the starting pattern and generation count.
It also resets the rule, scale, location, step size, selection and
hashing option to the values they had at the starting generation.
The starting generation is typically zero, but it can be larger after
loading an RLE/macrocell file that stores a non-zero generation count.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Faster</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[+ or =]

<p>
Increases the speed by displaying fewer generations.
The step size increases by a user-settable factor, initially 8 if the
Use Hashing option is ticked or 10 if it isn't.
Both factors can be changed in Preferences > Control.
Note that the hashing algorithm is most efficient when step sizes
are powers of 2.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Slower</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[- or _]

<p>
Decreases the speed by displaying more generations.
The step size decreases by a user-settable factor (see above).
If the step size is 1 (n^0) when you select this item then a small delay
will occur between each generation.  Further slowing will double the delay
until a maximum value is reached.  Use Preferences > Control to set the
minimum and maximum delay times.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Auto Fit</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[t]

<p>
If ticked then Golly will automatically fit a generating pattern inside
the view if any part of the pattern moves out of view.
This option is only used when doing many generations via Go or Next Step
(that's why it's in the Control menu rather than the View menu).

<p>
Note that if you are generating a pattern and decide to change scale or
do any sort of scrolling then the Auto Fit option is automatically
turned off (the assumption being that you now want manual control
over the scale and/or location).

<p>
TIP: If you find the Auto Fit option too confusing then leave it off
and hit "f" to manually fit the pattern inside the view whenever you like.

<a name="hashing"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Use Hashing</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then Golly will use a hashing algorithm to generate patterns.
The algorithm performs brilliantly on patterns that have a lot of regularity
in time or space.  Conversely, it can perform very poorly on chaotic patterns.
Hashing mode may initially appear to be slow, but as the hash table fills
up with knowledge about the pattern, it will run faster and faster,
so be patient.

<p>
Use Preferences > Control to set the maximum amount of memory when
hashing patterns.  The initial setting is 300MB.
The higher you set the memory limit, the larger patterns you can run
and the farther and faster you can run them.
However, setting this limit high also increases the amount of time
required to change the step size (both manually and in hyperspeed mode)
and increases the length of the garbage collection pauses.  Nonetheless,
it is generally best to set this as high as possible &mdash; typically
80-90% of the amount of physical memory in your computer.  Setting
this number high enough often makes more than a difference of 1000
in performance.  How high is high enough depends greatly on the
pattern and the step size, however, in unpredictable ways.

<p>
Note that toggling the hashing option resets the step size to 1 generation.
Hashing is automatically turned on after loading a macrocell pattern,
and automatically turned off if a loaded rule contains B0 but not S8.
You can also use the tool bar's "#" button to toggle hashing.

<p>
The status bar background is pale blue when hashing is turned on
and pale yellow when it's off.  Use Preferences > Color to change
these colors.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Hyperspeed</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, and Use Hashing is ticked, then Golly will automatically
increase the step size at regular intervals (every 64 steps).
Hyperspeed mode is a convenient way to run a complex pattern as far as possible.
(For very chaotic patterns, not using hashing may actually run it further.)
For highly regular patterns, hyperspeed mode quickly "runs away", generating
exponentially fast.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Hash Info</b></font>

<p>
Tick this option to turn on status messages that inform you when the
hashing algorithm is doing garbage collection, resizing its internal
hash table, or changing the step size (which can involve walking the
entire hash).  The garbage collection messages say which garbage
collection it is overall, and if it is a subsequent garbage collection
for the same step (the count will be in parentheses), and the
percentage of memory reclaimed.

<p>
Interpreting these numbers is more an art than a science because some
patterns exhibit odd behavior, but in general, if a garbage collection
is reclaiming less than 70% of the total memory, or more than ten
garbage collections occur for a single step, you can be fairly certain
that the algorithm is effectively stalled and further progress will be
extremely slow.  Reducing the step size may help, but it may need to
be reduced substantially in order to have an impact.  Increasing the
maximum memory that hashing can use may also help.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Rule...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog to change the current rule (which is displayed
inside square brackets in the main window's title bar).
Rules can be entered using standard "B0..8/S0..8" notation.
Case is not significant and the S part can come before the B part.
For example, Conway's Life rule can be entered as B3/S23 or s23/b3.
Alternatively, you can select from a list of named rules.

<p>
Golly also supports Wolfram's 1D rules.  These can be entered as "Wn"
where n is any even number from 0 to 254 (support for odd numbered
rules will have to wait for when we allow toroidal universes).
