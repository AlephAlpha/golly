<title>Golly Help: Control Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">
<font size=-1>

<p>
NOTE: [key] next to a menu item indicates a keyboard shortcut.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Go</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[g or return]

<p>
Starts generating the current pattern.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Stop</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[. or return or space]

<p>
Stops generating.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Next</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[space]

<p>
Advances to the next generation.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Next Step</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[tab]

<p>
Advances to the next step.  The current step size is displayed in the status bar
and can be changed by the Faster/Slower items (see below).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Reset</b></font>

<p>
Restores the starting pattern and resets the generation count to 0.
It also resets the rule, scale, location, step size and hashing option
to the values they had at generation 0.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Faster</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[+ or =]

<p>
Increases the speed by displaying fewer generations.
The step size increases by a user-settable factor, initially 8 if the
Use Hashing option is ticked or 10 if it isn't.
Both factors can be changed in the Preferences dialog.
Note that the hashing algorithm is most efficient when step sizes are powers of 2.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Slower</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[- or _]

<p>
Decreases the speed by displaying more generations.
The step size decreases by a user-settable factor (see above).
If the step size is 1 (n^0) when you select this item then a small delay
will occur between each generation.  Further slowing will double the delay
until a maximum value is reached.  The Preferences dialog can be used to
set the minimum and maximum delay times.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Auto Fit</b></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;[t]

<p>
If ticked then Golly will automatically fit a generating pattern inside
the view if any part of the pattern moves out of view.
This option is only used when doing many generations via Go or Next Step
(that's why it's in the Control menu rather than the View menu).

<p>
Note that if you are generating a pattern and decide to change scale or
do any sort of scrolling then the Auto Fit option is automatically
turned off (the assumption being that you now want manual control
over the scale and/or location).

<p>
TIP: If you find the Auto Fit option too confusing then leave it off
and hit "f" to manually fit the pattern inside the view whenever you like.

<a name="hashing"></a>
<p>
<font size=+1><b>Use Hashing</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then Golly will use a hashing algorithm to generate patterns.
The algorithm performs brilliantly on patterns that have a lot of regularity
in time or space.  Conversely, it can perform very poorly on chaotic patterns.
Hashing mode may initially appear to be slow, but as the hash table fills
up with knowledge about the pattern, it will run faster and faster,
so be patient.

<p>
Note that the hashing option cannot be changed while generating a pattern,
and changing it will reset the step size to 1 generation.
Hashing is automatically turned on after loading a macrocell pattern,
and automatically turned off if a loaded rule contains B0 but not S8.

<p>
The status bar background is pale blue when hashing is turned on
and pale yellow when it's off.
You can also use the tool bar's "H" button to toggle hashing.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Hyperspeed</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, and Use Hashing is ticked, then Golly will automatically
increase the step size at regular intervals (every 64 steps).
Hyperspeed mode is a convenient way to run a complex pattern as far as possible.
(For very chaotic patterns, not using hashing may actually run it further.)
For highly regular patterns, hyperspeed mode quickly "runs away", generating
exponentially fast.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Max Hash Memory...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog to set the maximum amount of memory used when generating
patterns with the hashing option ticked (see above).
The initial setting is 300MB.

<p>
The higher you set the memory limit, the larger
patterns you can run and the farther and faster you can run them.
However, setting this limit high also increases the amount of time
required to change the step size (both manually and in hyperspeed mode)
and increases the length of the garbage collection pauses.  Nonetheless,
it is generally best to set this as high as possible -- typically
80-90% of the amount of physical memory in your computer.  Setting
this number high enough often makes more than a difference of 1000
in performance.  How high is high enough depends greatly on the
pattern and the step size, however, in unpredictable ways.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Rule...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog to change the current rule (which is displayed
inside square brackets in the main window's title bar).
Rules can be entered using standard "B0..8/S0..8" notation.
Case is not significant and the S part can come before the B part.
For example, Conway's Life rule can be entered as B3/S23 or s23/b3.
If a given rule is not valid then the original rule will be restored.

<p>
[The dialog will eventually have a pop-up menu allowing you to select
from a list of named rules: Life, HighLife, Diamoeba, etc.]
