<title>Golly Help: Layer Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
Golly supports up to 10 layers.  Each layer is a separate universe
with its own algorithm (hashing or non-hashing), its own rule, viewport,
cursor mode, selection, step exponent, origin offset, and name.
The current layer's name is displayed in the main window's title bar.
Most edit/control/view operations only apply to the current layer.

<p>
Note that most of Golly's options apply globally to all layers.
This is true for all of the options set in the Preferences dialog.
It's also true for most of the options set via menu items like
Save Extended RLE, Paste Mode, Paste Location, Auto Fit,
Hyperspeed, Show Hash Info, Show Grid Lines, etc.

<p>
Common layer functions are also available via buttons in the "layer bar"
located above the viewport window.
Use Show Layer Bar in the View menu to show/hide the
layer bar, or just hit the "\" key.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Add Layer</b></font>

<p>
Adds a new layer (with an empty universe) immediately after the
current layer.  The new layer becomes the current layer and
inherits the previous layer's algorithm, rule, scale, location,
and cursor mode.  The step exponent is set to 0, there is no selection,
no origin offset, and the layer's initial name is "untitled".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Delete Layer</b></font>

<p>
Deletes the current layer.  The current layer changes to the previous
layer (unless layer 0 was deleted).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Delete Other Layers</b></font>

<p>
Deletes all layers except the current layer.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Move Layer...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog that lets you move any layer to a new position
in the layer sequence.  The chosen layer becomes the current layer.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Name Layer...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog that lets you change the name of the current layer.
Note that loading a pattern file also changes the layer's name.
Selecting New Pattern from the File menu resets the name to "untitled".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Synchronize Views</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, then when you switch to another layer Golly will automatically
switch to the same scale and location as the old current layer.
Most of the time you'll probably prefer to keep this option turned off
so that each layer has a different scale and location.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Synchronize Cursors</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, then when you switch to another layer Golly will automatically
switch to the same cursor mode as the old current layer.
You'll probably find it less confusing if this option is kept turned on,
but it can be useful in some situations for different layers to use
different cursors.  For example, you might want to make selections in
one layer but draw cells in another layer.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Stack Layers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then all layers are displayed on top of one another,
temporarily using the same scale and location as the current layer.
The pattern in layer 0 is drawn first (100% opaque), then the
patterns in other layers are drawn on top as translucent overlays.
The opacity of live cells in the overlays can be set in Preferences > Layer.
The colors for the live cells in each layer can be set in Preferences > Color.
For an example of how stacked layers can be useful, load in a pattern
and run the <b>smear.py</b> script.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Tile Layers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the viewport window is tiled into sub-windows and
each layer is displayed in a separate tile.  Clicking in the window
of a non-current layer will change the current layer.

<p>
The items at the bottom of the Layer menu show all existing layers,
along with their current names.  The current layer is ticked.
To switch to another layer just select the corresponding item.
