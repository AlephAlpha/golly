<title>Golly Help: Layer Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
Golly supports up to ten layers.  Each layer is a separate universe
(unless cloned; see the Clone Layer item below)
with its own algorithm (hashing or non-hashing), its own rule, viewport,
cursor mode, selection, step exponent, origin offset, and name.
The current layer's name is displayed in the main window's title bar.
Most edit/control/view operations only apply to the current layer.

<p>
Note that most of Golly's options apply globally to all layers.
This is true for all of the options set in the Preferences dialog.
It's also true for many of the options set via menu items, like
Save Extended RLE, Paste Mode, Paste Location,
Show Tool Bar, Show Grid Lines, etc., but not for any of the
Control menu options (Auto Fit, Hyperspeed, and Show Hash Info).

<p>
The items at the bottom of the Layer menu show all existing layers,
along with their current names.
The names of cloned layers are prefixed by one or more "=" signs;
all layers with the same number of "=" signs share the same universe.
The current layer is indicated by a tick.
To switch to another layer just select the corresponding item.
If a pattern is generating then you can only switch to another layer
if it is a clone of the current layer (you can't switch to a different
universe because there is a global rule table shared by all universes).
If a script is running then you can only switch to another layer if the
script has called <b>golly.setoption("switchlayers",True)</b>.

<p>
A layer containing a modified pattern is indicated by a "*"
at the start of the layer's name.  To avoid losing your changes,
a "save changes" dialog will appear before creating a new pattern,
opening a pattern file, deleting the layer, or quitting Golly.
If you'd rather not see this dialog then untick the appropriate
check boxes in Preferences > Layer.

<p>
Common layer functions are also available via buttons in the "layer bar"
located above the viewport window.
Use the Show Layer Bar item in the View menu to show/hide the
layer bar, or just hit the "\" key.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Add Layer</b></font>

<p>
Adds a new layer (with an empty universe) immediately after the
current layer.  The new layer becomes the current layer and
inherits the preceding layer's algorithm, rule, scale, location,
and cursor mode.  The step exponent is set to 0, there is no selection,
no origin offset, and the layer's initial name is "untitled".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Clone Layer</b></font>

<p>
Adds a new layer that shares the same universe and undo/redo history
as the current layer.
All of the current layer's settings are duplicated and most will be
kept synchronized so that a change to one clone automatically changes
all the others.  Each cloned layer does however have a separate viewport,
so the same pattern can be viewed at different scales and locations
(at the same time if layers are tiled).
Cloned layers can also have different names, cursor modes, or
control options (Auto Fit, Hyperspeed, and Show Hash Info).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Duplicate Layer</b></font>

<p>
Adds a new layer with a copy of the current layer's pattern.
Also duplicates all the current settings but, unlike a cloned layer,
the settings are not kept synchronized.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Delete Layer</b></font>

<p>
Deletes the current layer.  The current layer changes to the preceding
layer in the layer sequence (unless layer 0 was deleted).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Delete Other Layers</b></font>

<p>
Deletes all layers except the current layer.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Move Layer...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog that lets you move the current layer to a new position
in the layer sequence.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Name Layer...</b></font>

<p>
Brings up a dialog that lets you change the name of the current layer.
Note that loading a pattern file also changes the layer's name.
Creating a new pattern resets the name to "untitled".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Synchronize Views</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, then when you switch to another layer Golly will automatically
switch to the same scale and location as the old current layer.
Most of the time you'll probably prefer to keep this option turned off
so that each layer has a different scale and location.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Synchronize Cursors</b></font>

<p>
If ticked, then when you switch to another layer Golly will automatically
switch to the same cursor mode as the old current layer.
You'll probably find it less confusing if this option is kept turned on,
but it can be useful in some situations for different layers to use
different cursors.  For example, you might want to make selections in
one layer but draw cells in another layer.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Stack Layers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then all layers are displayed on top of one another,
temporarily using the same scale and location as the current layer.
The pattern in layer 0 is drawn first (100% opaque), then the
patterns in other layers are drawn on top as translucent overlays.
The colors for the live cells in each layer, and their opacity when stacked,
can be set in Preferences > Color.
For an example of how stacked layers can be useful, load in a pattern
and run the <b>envelope.py</b> script.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Tile Layers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the viewport window is tiled into sub-windows and
each layer is displayed in a separate tile.  Clicking in the window
of a non-current layer will change the current layer.
Tiling is very handy with cloned layers as it allows you to view
the same pattern at different scales and/or locations.
