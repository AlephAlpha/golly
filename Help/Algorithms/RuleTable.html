<title>Golly Help: RuleTable</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
The RuleTable algorithm allows rules to be specified by transition tables
stored in external files.  Given the rule string "foo", the RuleTable
algorithm will look inside the Rules folder for a file called foo.table.
Here are the currently supported rules:

<p><b><a href="rule#Byl-Loop">Byl-Loop</a></b> (1989)<br>
A six state 5-neighborhood CA that supports small self-replicating loops. Published in:
<blockquote>J. Byl. "Self-Reproduction in small cellular automata." Physica D, Vol. 34, pages 295-299, 1989.</blockquote>
To see the rule in action, open the loop itself:

<p><b><a href="rule#Chou-Reggia-1">Chou-Reggia-1</a></b> (1993)<br>
An eight state 5-neighborhood CA that supports tiny self-replicating loops. Published in:
<blockquote>J. A. Reggia, S.L.Armentrout, H.-H. Chou, and Y. Peng. "Simple systems that exhibit self-directed replication." Science, Vol. 259, pages 1282-1287, February 1993.</blockquote>
To see the rule in action, open the loop itself:
<a href="open#Patterns/Loops/Chou-Reggia-Loop-1.rle">Chou-Reggia Loop 1</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="rule#Chou-Reggia-2">Chou-Reggia-2</a></b> (1993)<br>
A second rule from the same paper, supporting an even smaller self-replicating loop of only five cells. To see the rule in action, open the loop itself:
<a href="open#Patterns/Loops/Chou-Reggia-Loop-2.rle">Chou-Reggia Loop 2</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="rule#Evoloop">Evoloop</a></b> (1999)<br>
An extension of the SDSR Loop, designed to allow evolution through collisions. Published in:
<blockquote>Hiroki Sayama "Toward the Realization of an Evolving Ecosystem on Cellular Automata", Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (AROB 4th '99), M. Sugisaka and H. Tanaka, eds., pp.254-257, Beppu, Oita, Japan, 1999.</blockquote>

<p><b><a href="rule#Langtons-Loops">Langtons-Loops</a></b> (1984)<br>
The original loop. Chris Langton adapted Codd's 1968 CA to support a simple form of self-replication based on a circulating loop of instructions. Published in:
<blockquote>C.G.Langton. "Self-reproduction in cellular automata." Physica D, Vol. 10, pages 135-144, 1984.</blockquote>

<p><b><a href="rule#SDSR-Loop">SDSR-Loop</a></b> (1998)<br>
An extension of Langton's Loops, designed to cause dead loops to disappear, allowing other loops to replicate further. Published in:
<blockquote>Hiroki Sayama.  "Introduction of Structural Dissolution into Langton's Self-Reproducing Loop."  Artificial Life VI: Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Artificial Life, C. Adami, R. K. Belew, H. Kitano, and C. E. Taylor, eds., pp.114-122, Los Angeles, California, 1998, MIT Press.</blockquote>

<p><b><a href="rule#WireWorld">WireWorld</a></b> (1987)<br>
A 4-state CA created by Brian Silverman.
WireWorld models the flow of currents in wires and makes it relatively
easy to build logic gates and other digital circuits. Popularised by:
<blockquote>Dewdney, A. K. Computer Recreations. Scientific American 282:136-139, 1990.</blockquote>
