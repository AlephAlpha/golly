<title>Golly Help: HashLife</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
HashLife uses Bill Gosper's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife">hashlife</a>
algorithm to achieve remarkable speeds when generating patterns
that have a lot of regularity in time and/or space.

<p>
HashLife supports the same set of rules as
<a href="QuickLife.html">QuickLife</a>, but with one exception:
it cannot handle any rule that contains B0 but not S8.

<p>
Note that HashLife performs very poorly on highly chaotic patterns,
so in those cases you are better off switching to QuickLife.
