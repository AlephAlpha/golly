<title>Golly Help: WireWorld</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
WireWorld is a 2D four-color cellular automaton created by Brian Silverman.
Only one rule (called WireWorld) is supported.

<p>
WireWorld models the flow of currents in wires and makes it relatively
easy to build logic gates and other digital circuits.
For an impressive example, see the prime number generator
in Patterns/WireWorld-Examples.
