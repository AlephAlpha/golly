<title>Golly Help: QuickLife</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
QuickLife is a fast, conventional (non-hashing) algorithm for
exploring Life and other 2D outer-totalistic rules.
Such rules are defined using "B0...8/S0...8" notation, where
the digits after B specify the counts of live neighbors necessary
for a cell to be born in the next generation, and the digits
after S specify the counts of live neighbors necessary for a
cell to survive to the next generation.
Here are some example rules:

<p><b>B3/S23</b> [Life]<br>
John Conway's rule is by far the best known and most explored CA.

<p><b>B36/S23</b> [HighLife]<br>
Very similar to Conway's Life but with an interesting replicator.

<p><b>B3678/S34678</b> [Day & Night]<br>
Dead cells in a sea of live cells behave the same as live cells
in a sea of dead cells.

<p><b>B35678/S5678</b> [Diamoeba]<br>
Creates diamond-shaped blobs with unpredictable behavior.

<p><b>B2</b> [Seeds]<br>
Every living cell dies every generation, but most patterns still explode.

<p><b>B234</b> [Serviettes or Persian Rug]<br>
A single 2x2 block turns into a set of Persian rugs.

<p><b>B345/S5</b> [LongLife]<br>
Oscillators with extremely long periods can occur quite naturally.

<p>
QuickLife also supports Stephen Wolfram's 1D CA rules.
These rules are specified as "Wn" where n is an even number from
0 to 254.  For example:

<p><b>W22</b><br>
A single live cell creates a beautiful fractal pattern.

<p><b>W30</b><br>
Highly chaotic and an excellent random number generator.

<p><b>W110</b><br>
Matthew Cook proved that this rule is capable of universal computation.
