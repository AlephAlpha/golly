<title>Golly Help: View Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Full Screen</b></font>

<p>
Switches to full screen mode, automatically hiding the menu bar, the status bar,
the tool bar, the layer bar, the edit bar, the pattern/script folder and
the scroll bars.
To exit from this mode just hit the menu item's keyboard shortcut
or any unassigned key.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire pattern fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Selection</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire selection fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Middle</b></font>

<p>
Moves the origin cell (0,0) to the middle of the view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Restore Origin</b></font>

<p>
Restores the true origin.
The origin cell can be changed by hitting "0" while the cursor is over the
view &mdash; the cell under the cursor will become the new origin and its location
will be displayed as 0,0.  This can be handy for measuring distances or for
saving a location and returning to it quickly by hitting "m".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom In</b></font>

<p>
Zooms in by doubling the current scale.
If the scale is 1:16 then you can't zoom in any further.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom Out</b></font>

<p>
Zooms out by halving the current scale.
Golly has an unbounded universe so you can zoom out as far as you like.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Set Scale</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you set the scale from 1:1 to 1:16.
A quicker method is to use these keyboard shortcuts:
"1" for 1:1, "2" for 1:2, "4" for 1:4, "8" for 1:8 and "6" for 1:16.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Tool Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the tool bar at the left edge of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Layer Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the layer bar above the viewport window (and above the
edit bar if it's visible).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Edit Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the edit bar above the viewport window.
The edit bar contains buttons for undo and redo, buttons for
changing the cursor mode, a button for showing/hiding all states
(see below), boxes showing the current drawing state's color and
icon, and a scroll bar for changing the drawing state.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show All States</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the edit bar is made larger and the colors and icons
for all cell states in the current universe are displayed.
A box is drawn around the current drawing state; to change it just
click on a different state.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Status Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the status bar at the top of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Exact Numbers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the status bar is made larger and exact numbers are
displayed instead of using scientific notation.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Grid Lines</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the grid lines.
Use <a href="prefs:view">Preferences > View</a>
to turn off the bold grid lines or change their spacing.
You can also set the minimum scale at which grid lines should be displayed
(1:4, 1:8 or 1:16).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Cell Icons</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then icons will be displayed at scales 1:8 and 1:16.
Icons are small bitmaps that can have any shape but their color is
automatically synchronized with the cell's state color.
Each algorithm can have a different set of icons.  You can change these
icons by loading suitably formatted files via the "Load Icons" button
in <a href="prefs:color">Preferences > Color</a>.

<p>
It's also possible to have rule-specific icons.  Whenever Golly
switches to a new rule it looks inside the Rules folder for a matching
<i>rule</i>.icons file and, if it exists, loads the bitmaps stored in
the file.  The format of a .icons file is identical to that used above.
See <a href="formats.html#icons">Help > File Formats</a> for a
description of the format.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Invert Colors</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the colors of all cell states in all layers are inverted;
i.e., each r, g, b value is changed to 255-r, 255-g, 255-b.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Buffered</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then window buffering is used to avoid flicker, but it does
slow down pattern rendering a bit so you might prefer to live with the flicker.
Note that buffering is always used if grid lines are displayed
or if a selection is visible.

<p>
This option is disabled on Mac OS X and Linux/GTK because windows are
automatically buffered on those systems.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Pattern Info</b></font>

<p>
Displays any comments in the current pattern file.
