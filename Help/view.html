<title>Golly Help: View Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Full Screen</b></font>

<p>
Switches to full screen mode, automatically hiding the menu bar, the status bar,
the tool bar, the layer bar, the pattern/script folder and the scroll bars.
To exit from this mode just hit the menu item's keyboard shortcut
or any unassigned key.
[Not supported on X11.]

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire pattern fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Selection</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire selection fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Middle</b></font>

<p>
Moves the origin cell (0,0) to the middle of the view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Restore Origin</b></font>

<p>
Restores the true origin.
The origin cell can be changed by hitting "0" while the cursor is over the
view &mdash; the cell under the cursor will become the new origin and its location
will be displayed as 0,0.  This can be handy for measuring distances or for
saving a location and returning to it quickly by hitting "m".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom In</b></font>

<p>
Zooms in by doubling the current scale.
If the scale is 1:16 then you can't zoom in any further.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom Out</b></font>

<p>
Zooms out by halving the current scale.
Golly has an unbounded universe so you can zoom out as far as you like.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Set Scale</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you set the scale from 1:1 to 1:16.
A quicker method is to use these keyboard shortcuts:
"1" for 1:1, "2" for 1:2, "4" for 1:4, "8" for 1:8 and "6" for 1:16.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Tool Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the tool bar at the left edge of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Layer Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the layer bar above the viewport window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Status Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the status bar at the top of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Exact Numbers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the status bar is made larger and exact numbers are
displayed instead of using scientific notation.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Grid Lines</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the grid lines.
Use <a href="prefs#view">Preferences > View</a>
to turn off the bold grid lines or change their spacing,
or to set the minimum scale at which grid lines should be displayed
(1:4, 1:8 or 1:16).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Swap Cell Colors</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the colors used to display cell states are swapped.
Use <a href="prefs#color">Preferences > Color</a> to change these
(and other) colors.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Buffered</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then window buffering is used to avoid flicker, but it does
slow down pattern rendering a bit so you might prefer to live with the flicker.
Note that buffering is always used if grid lines are displayed
or if a selection is visible.

<p>
This option is disabled on Mac OS X because windows are automatically buffered.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Pattern Info</b></font>

<p>
Displays any comments in the current pattern file.
