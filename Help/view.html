<title>Golly Help: View Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Full Screen</b></font>

<p>
Switches to full screen mode, automatically hiding the menu bar, the status bar,
the tool bar, the layer bar, the pattern/script folder and the scroll bars.
To exit from this mode just hit the menu item's keyboard shortcut
or any unassigned key.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Pattern</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire pattern fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Fit Selection</b></font>

<p>
Changes the scale and location so the entire selection fits within the current view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Middle</b></font>

<p>
Moves the origin cell (0,0) to the middle of the view.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Restore Origin</b></font>

<p>
Restores the true origin.
The origin cell can be changed by hitting "0" while the cursor is over the
view &mdash; the cell under the cursor will become the new origin and its location
will be displayed as 0,0.  This can be handy for measuring distances or for
saving a location and returning to it quickly by hitting "m".

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom In</b></font>

<p>
Zooms in by doubling the current scale.
If the scale is 1:16 then you can't zoom in any further.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Zoom Out</b></font>

<p>
Zooms out by halving the current scale.
Golly has an unbounded universe so you can zoom out as far as you like.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Set Scale</b></font>

<p>
This submenu lets you set the scale from 1:1 to 1:16.
A quicker method is to use these keyboard shortcuts:
"1" for 1:1, "2" for 1:2, "4" for 1:4, "8" for 1:8 and "6" for 1:16.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Tool Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the tool bar at the left edge of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Layer Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the layer bar above the viewport window (and above the
edit bar if it's visible).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Edit Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the edit bar above the viewport window.
The edit bar contains buttons for undo and redo, buttons for
changing the cursor mode, a button for showing/hiding all states
(see below), boxes showing the current drawing state's color and
icon, and a scroll bar for changing the drawing state.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show All States</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the edit bar is made larger and the colors and icons
for all cell states in the current universe are displayed.
A box is drawn around the current drawing state; to change it just
click on a different state.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Status Bar</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the status bar at the top of the main window.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Exact Numbers</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the status bar is made larger and exact numbers are
displayed instead of using scientific notation.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Grid Lines</b></font>

<p>
Shows or hides the grid lines.
Use <a href="prefs#view">Preferences > View</a>
to turn off the bold grid lines or change their spacing,
or to set the minimum scale at which grid lines should be displayed
(1:4, 1:8 or 1:16).

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Show Cell Icons</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then icons will be displayed at scales 1:8 and 1:16.
Icons are small bitmaps that can have any shape but their color is
automatically synchronized with the cell's state color.
Each algorithm can have a different set of icons.  You can change these
icons by loading suitably formatted files via the "Load Icons" button
in <a href="prefs#color">Preferences > Color</a>.
Golly can load icon bitmaps from BMP, GIF, PNG or TIFF files.
This picture shows how the bitmaps must be arranged:

<p>
<center><img src="icon_format.bmp"></center>

<p>
The top row contains one or more icons of size 15x15, so the total width
must be a multiple of 15.
The bottom row contains icons of size 7x7, with each icon under the
bottom left corner of its corresponding 15x15 icon.
The 7x7 icons are optional; if not supplied (ie. the total height is 15
rather than 22) then Golly will create them by scaling down the 15x15 icons.
Scaled icons can look rather ugly, so this isn't recommended.
Pure black (0,0,0) must be used for the areas you want to be transparent.
The non-black areas will be replaced with the current cell's state color.
If the number of icons supplied is fewer than the number of live states
then the last icon is automatically duplicated.  If there are more icons
than required then the extra icons are simply ignored.

<p>
It's also possible to have rule-specific icons.  Whenever Golly
switches to a new rule it looks inside the Rules folder for a matching
<i>rule</i>.icons file and, if it exists, loads the bitmaps stored in
the file.  The format of a .icons file is identical to that used above.
Note that a rule string can contain characters not allowed in file names
("/", "\" and ":"), so in those cases Golly will look for a file name
containing hyphens instead of the illegal characters.  For example,
if you wanted to change the icon associated with the rule B3/S23 then
you'd need to create a file called B3-S23.icons.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Invert Colors</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then the colors of all cell states in all layers are inverted.
Each r, g, b value is changed to 255-r, 255-g, 255-b.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Buffered</b></font>

<p>
If ticked then window buffering is used to avoid flicker, but it does
slow down pattern rendering a bit so you might prefer to live with the flicker.
Note that buffering is always used if grid lines are displayed
or if a selection is visible.

<p>
This option is disabled on Mac OS X and Linux/GTK because windows are
automatically buffered on those systems.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>Pattern Info</b></font>

<p>
Displays any comments in the current pattern file.
