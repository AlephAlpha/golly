<font size=+1><b>Some useful hints and tips</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
To view a pattern file just drop it onto the Golly app or onto the
Golly window if the app is already running.
</li>
<li>
When Golly starts up it looks for scripts called
<b>golly-start.pl</b> or <b>golly-start.py</b>
in the same directory as the Golly application and then in a user-specific
data directory (see the <a href="file.html#prefs">Preferences</a> item
for the likely path on your system).
If either script is found then it is automatically executed.
</li>
<li>
Displaying the population count can cause a significant slow-down when
generating large patterns, especially when using HashLife.
If you want to generate at maximum speed then just hit ";" to hide
the status bar.  You can toggle the status bar at any time,
even in full screen mode.
</li>
<li>
Editing operations are fastest in QuickLife.
</li>
<li>
Pasting large, sparse patterns is much faster if using Or mode,
or if the current pattern is empty,
or if the paste rectangle is completely outside the current pattern edges.
</li>
<li>
The hand cursor can be used to scroll the view by clicking and dragging.
If you drag the cursor outside any view edge then scrolling will occur
continuously; ie. you don't have to move the cursor.
If the cursor is outside any corner (ie. outside two edges) then the
scrolling direction will be diagonal.
</li>
<li>
Actually, continuous scrolling also occurs if the hand cursor is dragged
onto any view edge or corner.  This allows such scrolling to occur in
full screen mode.
</li>
<li>
While dragging the mouse to make (or modify) a selection, the escape key
can be used to cancel the operation and restore the original selection.
</li>
<li>
Avoid the temptation to put your own patterns, scripts or rules inside Golly's
supplied folders &mdash; it will make it difficult to upgrade to a future version.
A much better idea is to create separate folders for your own files and put those folders
alongside the supplied folders, so your Golly folder looks something like this:

<p><table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>
<tr><td>Golly</td><td width=20> </td> <td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golly.exe</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td>(Golly.app on Mac, golly on Linux)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patterns</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripts</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My-downloads</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td>(contains all your downloaded files; select in
         <a href="prefs:file">Preferences > File</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My-patterns</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td>(contains all your pattern files)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My-rules</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td>(contains all your .rule files; select in
         <a href="prefs:control">Preferences > Control</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My-scripts</td><td width=20> </td>
    <td>(contains all your .pl/.py files)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Use File > Set Patterns Folder and select the Golly folder.  Now all your folders
(and the supplied folders) are visible in the patterns panel, so with just a
few clicks you can load any pattern, run any script, or switch to any .rule file.
Or you can right-click (or control-click) on any of those files to open them
in your <a href="prefs:file">preferred text editor</a>.
When upgrading to a new version of Golly, simply drag all the distributed files
and folders into your Golly folder and replace the old versions.
