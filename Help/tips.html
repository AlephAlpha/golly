<font size=+1><b>Some useful hints and tips</b></font>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
To view a pattern file just drop it onto the Golly app or onto the
Golly window if the app is already running.
[Not supported on X11.]
</li>
<li>
If a script called golly-start.pl or golly-start.py exists in the same
folder as the application then it is automatically executed when
Golly starts up.
</li>
<li>
Displaying the population count can cause a significant slow-down when
generating large patterns, especially when using the hashing option.
If you want to generate at maximum speed then just hit ";" to hide
the status bar.  You can toggle the status bar at any time,
even in full screen mode.
</li>
<li>
Editing operations are faster when the hashing option is turned off.
</li>
<li>
Pasting large, sparse patterns is much faster if using Or mode,
or if the current pattern is empty,
or if the paste rectangle is completely outside the current pattern edges.
</li>
<li>
The hand cursor can be used to scroll the view by clicking and dragging.
If you drag the cursor outside any view edge then scrolling will occur
continuously; ie. you don't have to move the cursor.
If the cursor is outside any corner (ie. outside two edges) then the
scrolling direction will be diagonal.
</li>
<li>
Actually, continuous scrolling also occurs if the hand cursor is dragged
onto any view edge or corner.  This allows such scrolling to occur in
full screen mode.
</li>
<li>
While dragging the mouse to make (or modify) a selection, the escape key
can be used to cancel the operation and restore the original selection.
</li>
</ul>
