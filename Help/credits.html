<p>
<font size=+1><b>The pioneers</b></font>

<p>
First and foremost, a big thanks to John Conway for creating the Game of Life,
and to Martin Gardner for popularizing the topic in his Scientific American
column.

<p>
<font size=+1><b>The programmers</b></font>

<p>
Tom Rokicki wrote most of the complicated stuff.
Golly is essentially the merging of two of Tom's programs (hlife and qlife).
The hashing algorithm is based on an idea by Bill Gosper.
The more conventional algorithm uses some ideas from Alan Hensel.
David Eppstein provided the idea on how to emulate B0 rules.

<p>
Andrew Trevorrow wrote the cross-platform GUI code using
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>.
Much thanks to Julian Smart and all the other wxWidgets developers
and sample code authors.

<p>
Golly's scripting capabilities are a result of the generosity and efforts of
Eugene Langvagen (author of <a href="http://plife.sourceforge.net/">PLife</a>),
and Guido van Rossum (creator of <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>).

<p>
Jason Summers added mouse wheel support and other improvements.

<p>
