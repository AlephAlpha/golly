Dragging the sash (the thin vertical bar separating the file panel
and the viewport) can result in ugly flashing.

<p>
<ul>
<li>
Scroll bars are not updated correctly while resizing the window.
<li>
Golly has serious problems with Ubuntu's Unity interface.  For example,
selecting a modal dialog like Control > Set Rule can freeze Golly.
There are also problems with overlay scrollbars.
Most (all?) of the problems can be solved by disabling both the global menu bar
and the overlay scrollbars.  This can be done just for the golly binary by using
the following alias:

<table border=0><pre>
alias golly="UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 LIBOVERLAY_SCROLLBAR=0 ./golly"</pre></table>
