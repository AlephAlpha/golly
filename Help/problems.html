<ul>
<li>
All editing operations are restricted to cells whose coordinates
are within +/- 1 billion.
<li>
The QuickLife algorithm has a minor bug that can cause selecting
a large pattern to appear to be incorrect.  The selection is actually
correct but the rectangle is slightly offset (by one pixel).
<li>
Pattern rendering needs to be optimized, especially in the Mac and Linux apps.
The solution will probably require using OpenGL rather than wxDC calls.
