<p>
<ul>
<li>
Golly is a work in progress and we hope to add more features,
including support for non-rectangular selections
and more sophisticated editing capabilities.
<li>
All editing operations are restricted to cells whose coordinates
are within +/- 1 billion.  There is also a bug in the HashLife
algorithm that prevents you from editing any cell states if the
pattern is very large (outside the +/- 1 billion limits).
<li>
The QuickLife algorithm has a minor bug that can cause selecting
a large pattern to appear to be incorrect.  The selection is actually
correct but the rectangle is slightly offset (by one pixel).
<li>
Pattern rendering needs to be optimized, especially in the Mac and Linux apps.
