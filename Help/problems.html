<p>
<ul>
<li>
Golly is a work in progress and we hope to add more features:
support for toroidal universes, cells with more than two states,
non-rectangular selections.
<li>
All editing operations are restricted to cells whose coordinates
are within +/- 1 billion.  There is also a bug in the hashing
algorithm that prevents you from editing any cell states if the
pattern is very large (outside the +/- 1 billion limits).
<li>
Pattern rendering needs to be optimized.
</ul>

<font size=+1><b>Linux/X11 problems</b></font>

<p>
The Linux/X11 app is no longer supported (the source code doesn't compile
due to limitations in wxX11).
Linux users will have to run the GTK version of Golly.
