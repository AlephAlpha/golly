<li> The tool bar cannot be toggled on/off.
<li> No support for full screen mode.
<li> No support for dropping pattern files onto the main window.
<li> Limited clipboard support (you can only Paste after using Cut/Copy).
<li> Links in the help window can lose their color.
<li> No alpha channel support so inversion is used for selections.

<li> Escape key doesn't cancel progress dialog.
