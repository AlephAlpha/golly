<p>
<ul>
<li>
Golly is a work in progress and we hope to add more features:
support for toroidal universes, more editing functions (eg. undo),
configurable keyboard shortcuts.
<li>
All editing operations are restricted to cells whose coordinates
are within +/- 1 billion.  There is also a bug in the hashing
algorithm that prevents you from editing any cell states if the
pattern is very large (outside the +/- 1 billion limits).
<li>
Pattern rendering needs to be optimized.
</ul>

<font size=+1><b>Linux/X11 problems</b></font>

<p>
Linux users are strongly advised to install GTK+ and run the GTK
version of Golly.  Unfortunately the X11 version has lots of bugs:

<p>
<ul>
<li> Resizing the main window very small can cause Golly to crash
     (and another bug prevents setting the window's minimum size -- sheesh!).
<li> The tool bar has to be horizontal to avoid menu bar bugs.
<li> The tool bar cannot be toggled on/off.
<li> No support for full screen mode.
<li> No support for dropping pattern files onto the main window.
<li> Limited clipboard support (you can only Paste after using Cut/Copy).
<li> You can't use Preferences > Color to change any colors.
     You'll have to quit Golly and edit the *_rgb settings in GollyPrefs.
<li> Links in the help window can lose their color.
<li> No alpha channel support so inversion is used for selections.
<li> Can't create our own magnifying-glass cursors so arrows are used.
<li> Escape key doesn't cancel progress dialog.
</ul>
