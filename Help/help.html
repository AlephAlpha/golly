<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">

<p>
The Help menu items can be used to display information on a variety of topics.
Each item corresponds to a .html file in the Help folder.
The information is displayed in a separate help window
which behaves like a simplified browser.
The size and location of this window is remembered when it closes.

Various keyboard shortcuts can be used when the help window is in front:

<li> Hit the left arrow or "[" to go back.
<li> Hit the right arrow or "]" to go forwards.
<li> Hit the home key to go to the Contents page.
<li> Hit the up/down arrow keys or page up/down keys if a scroll bar appears.
<li> Hit Ctrl-A on Windows/Linux or Cmd-A on Mac to select all text.
<li> Hit Ctrl-C on Windows/Linux or Cmd-C on Mac to copy selected text
     to the clipboard.
