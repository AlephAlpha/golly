<title>Golly Help: Help Menu</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFCE">
<font size=-1>

<p>
The Help menu items can be used to display information on a variety of topics.
Each item corresponds to a .html file in the Help folder.
The information is displayed in a separate help window
which behaves like a simplified browser.
Golly remembers the size and location of this window when it closes.

<p>
These keyboard shortcuts can be used when the help window is in front:

<p>
<ul>
<li> Hit the up/down arrow keys or page up/down keys if a scroll bar appears.
<li> Hit "[" to go back.
<li> Hit "]" to go forwards.
<li> Hit the home key to go to the Contents page.
<li> Hit Ctrl-C on Windows/X11 or Cmd-C on Mac OS X to copy selected text
to the clipboard.
<li> Hit escape or return to close the help window.
</ul>
