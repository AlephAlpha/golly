<ul>
<li>
All editing operations are restricted to cells whose coordinates
are within +/- 1 billion.  Not much of a limitation really!
</ul>
    
<p>
Note that this version of Golly has a number of significant limitations
when compared with the desktop version:
<ul>
<li> No scripting.
<li> No multiple layers.
<li> No timelines.
<li> No hyperspeed mode.
<li> You can't change the colors, base step, nor origin.
</ul>
Some of these capabilities might be added in future versions.
