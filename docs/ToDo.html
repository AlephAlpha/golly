Andrew's list:
==============

- Optimize rendering by eliminating lots of DrawRectangle/DrawBitmap calls.
  Instead, each layer has a viewport-sized buffer into which we "draw"
  and then convert that to a wxBitmap and call DrawBitmap *once*.
  Other advantages:
  1. We could expose the buffer to scripting commands (setpixel/getpixel)
     so that scripts could do fancy stuff like overlay images/text.
  2. It should make it easier further down the track if we wanted to avoid
     wx's DrawBitmap (which I suspect is not optimal) and use OpenGL or
     SDL or SFML.  On Mac, use Quartz?

- Auto stop script if it creates too many temp files (for undo).
  This can happen if a long-running script doesn't call new/open
  when it probably should.  See my email to Nathaniel with subject
  "Re: Golly methuselah search script".

- Change all Python commands to g_* for consistency with Perl commands.
  Unfortutely, we can't really keep the old commands in same module
  because doing "from golly import *" exposes old and new commands and
  so a script like goto.py that calls a non-Golly open command will fail.
  We could put old commands in a separate module called "oldgolly".
  Maybe best to leave this change for when the scripting API needs
  significant changes due to multi-rect selections.

- Avoid any remaining algo assumptions (search *_ALGO):
  - Need IsParityShifted() method to avoid QLIFE_ALGO assumption?

- Allow dragging zoom-in cursor to zoom into rect.

- Stop generating if pattern becomes empty, constant or p2 (qlife only)
  and display suitable message in status bar.  Or maybe just add
  Gabriel's oscillation detection as an option (see oscar.py).

- Allow non-rectangular (and disjoint) selections.

- Add simple methuselah/spaceship/osc/still-life searches as in LifeLab???

- Fix glitches in the way the algo button works:
  - On Mac we want button to look selected before menu appears.
  - On Win we want to be able to press-select-release.

- Fix wxMac bug: Set Rule's help win can't regain focus after clicking
  in scroll bar (and thus we can't copy text).

- Add case studies to BUILD file: how to add a new menu item, how to add
  a new algorithm, etc.


Tom's list:
===========

File I/O

- Have hlifealgo .mc compatible with ghashbase .mc
- Generalized RLE in MC?

Algos

- Unzoom color merging
- Better status reports (% of hashtable full)

Scripting

- Tape construction script for replicator

Samples

- Small JVN examples

Fun

- htreebase
- hgridbase (finite universe; torus, etc.)
- allow (base) x (slow) algorithm "multiplication"
- pluggability of externally-defined algos
- perl/python slowcalc callbacks
- cache of slowcalc
- generational gc
- 32-bit indexed hashlife on 64-bit platforms

Other

- Improve batchmode.

- Fix qlifealgo::lowerRightPixel to prevent off-by-one error when
  selecting large pattern like caterpillar.


User suggestions:
=================

Nick Gotts:
- Need a way to copy exact gen/pop counts to clipboard.
  [No longer necessary now that a script can get this info.]

Jason Summers:
- For better viewing of patterns that move, have a way to automatically
  move the view X cells horizontally and Y cells vertically every Z gens.
  [Could be done quite easily via a script that prompts for X,Y,Z.]
- Allow diagonal selection rectangles.

Dave Greene:
- Provide a way to click-and-drag a selection to move it around.
- Make page and arrow scrolling amounts configurable (in Prefs > View).
- Add a getview() script command that returns current viewport rect
  and a setview(rect) command to change viewport size and location.
- Make info window a floating window and keep it open (but update
  its contents) when user loads another pattern.

H. Koenig:
- Multiple windows.  [No real need now that we have multiple layers.]

Gabriel Nivasch:
- Make paste pattern semi-transparent.  [Tried it -- somewhat confusing.]
- Add a Default button to each Preferences pane (at bottom left?).

Bill Gosper:
- Modify info window so it can be used to edit and save comments.
- For scales > 1:1 make the pixel color depend on lg(# of ones in it).

Brice Due:
- Provide MCell-like editing capabilities.
- Provide a thumbnail option as an alternative to tiled layers;
  ie. the current layer would be displayed in a large "focal" viewport.
  All layers would be displayed as small, active thumbnails (at left
  or top edge of focal viewport, depending on aspect ratio?).
- Allow mc files to set step base and/or exponent via comment line like
  #X stepbase=8 stepexp=3
  [No need now that zip files can contain pattern + script?]

Tim Hutton:
- Add a script command to save comments in a pattern file.  Add optional
  param to existing save() command?

William R. Buckley:
- Provide an option to increase spacing between buttons.

Dean Hickerson:
- Make Duplicate Layer faster by writing current pattern to temp file
  and reading it into new layer.

tod222:
- Provide a way to cleanly shut down Golly from within a script.
  Maybe just use special exit() string like exit("QUIT GOLLY")?
  [No need -- can now call doevent("key q cmd").]
- Allow a command line argument (-minimize?) to start up with the
  main window in minimized state.  Shoule be possible in OnInit.
