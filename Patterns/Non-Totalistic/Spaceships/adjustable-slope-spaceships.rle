#C     The isotropic rule has a 3-cell c/2 orthogonal spaceship and a
#C still life dot. Interestingly, one of the spaceship+dot collisions
#C displaces a dot by (2,0) and reflects the spaceship to the adjacent
#C lane. This allows for spaceships with adjustable slopes to be made.
#C     The spaceships demonstrated in this pattern has the following
#C speeds respectively, from left to right:
#C (10,2)c/324, slope 10/2=5;
#C (8,2)c/260, slope 8/2=4;
#C (6,2)c/196, slope 6/2=3;
#C (4,2)c/132, slope 4/2=2;
#C (8,6)c/460, slope 8/6=4/3.
#C     Apart from these, orthogonal (slope=0) and diagonal (slope=1)
#C spaceships are also possible. Note how the first four make use of
#C two smaller 2c/64 orthogonal ones at the top and bottom; by
#C adjusting the distance d of two dots, it attains all orthogonal
#C speeds of the form 2c/(4d-12) for d>= 6.
