#C This pattern shows a simulation of high-period XOR oscillators in a
#C Margolus rule, using 2x2 regions in an isotropic non-totalistic
#C (INT) rule. A summary of the Margolus rulespace can be found here:

#C
#C In this case, all five possible "Margolus media" actually coexist
#C in a single rule: blocks can be filled, 3/4 filled, 1/2 filled
#C (in two different ways), or 1/4 filled.  Many INT rules can emulate
#C Margolus rules with one or the other of these methods, but rules
#C that allow all of the methods simultaneously are much rarer.
#C
#C As lines are made longer, the oscillator periods change radically,
#C occasionally becoming very large.  See also horiship-guns.rle.
