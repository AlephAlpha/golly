#C A simple demonstration of how it's possible to change only one
#C transition to obtain a rule that contains two oscillator families
#C following two distinct MarBlocks rules. In this case, the diagonal
#C lines follow M11, and the blocky oscillators follow M10.
#C
#C Open this pattern with showinviewer.lua to see labels which
#C indicate the period of each of these oscillators. They can be
#C seen to follow Sloane's A085587 (linked below).
