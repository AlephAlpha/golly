#C This is a comparison of two "MarBlocks" oscillator families
#C listed next to each other for behavioural comparison.
#C "MarBlocks" oscillators are named in reference to several rules
#C where patterns made of solid 2Ã—2 blocks remain composed of 2Ã—2
#C blocks emulating a simpler cellular automaton which uses the
#C Margolus neighbourhood and partitioning scheme.
#C
#C The most known rule of its kind, B36/S125, has many interesting
#C oscillators composed of these 2Ã—2 blocks. For example, starting
#C configurations made of continuous rows of 2Ã—2 blocks (that is, 
#C solid rectangles two cells high and an even number of cells
#C long) generally evolve into oscillators of increasingly high
#C periods. These are the oscillators which can be seen on the left.
#C The simplest rule to harbour these is B3i/S5i.
#C
#C At any given time, one of these oscillators can be described as
#C a XOR of other even-by-even rectangles in such a way that the
#C the resulting pattern can still be broken down into 2Ã—2 blocks.
#C In addition, the edges of said oscillators can be analysed as
#C emulating Rule 90, a rule many common replicators are bound by.
#C
#C A family of oscillators exists in the isotropic rule B2e/S which
#C behave identically to the 2Ã—2 block oscillators found in B36/S125.
#C Specifically, any configuration composed of correctly-aligned 2Ã—2
#C blocks in B36/S125 has a functionally identical equivalent in the
#C the rule B2e/S. For example, a diagonal line of length n cells in
#C B2e/S will oscillate with the same period (and mod) as a rectangle
#C with height 2 and width 2n in B36/S125.
#C
#C Several other rules exist with families of oscillators exhibiting
#C this exact behaviour, and such oscillator families are thus
#C referred to as "MarBlocks".
#C
#C As the length increases, the oscillator periods change radically,
#C occasionally becoming very large.  See also horiship-guns.rle.
#C
#C Both the "2Ã—2 block" and "diagonal line" MarBlocks oscillators
#C can coexist in a single rule, making a visual proof of their
#C functional equivalency simple.
#C
#C Open this pattern with showinviewer.lua to see labels which
#C indicate the period of each of these oscillators. They can be
#C seen to follow Sloane's A085587 (linked below).
