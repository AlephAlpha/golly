#C     High-period reflectorless rotating oscillators are of interest
#C in the isotropic non-totalistic (INT) rulespace. Most RROs have a
#C chaotic c/2 orthogonal movement between 90-degree turns. For an
#C extreme example see loopability-104-rro.rle.
#C
#C This RRO is an exception: its frontend moves at (2,1)c/5. A single
#C copy has a period of 112, so it is 1,2,4-loopable.
