#C   The R-pentomino in this rule is a novel two-dimensional quadratic
#C replicator.
#C   Let current generation be gen 0. The first child copy comes into
#C being at gen 42, centered at (3,8), and rotated 180 degrees. The 
#C second one occurs at gen 46, centered at (6,19), rotated 90 degrees
#C clockwise. They continue to replicate, forming larger and larger
#C  arrays of child copies in the shape of isosceles right triangles.
