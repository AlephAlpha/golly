The pattern looks roughly like this; view in a fixed-width font:

The lines AE, BF, and DF are straight; the others are jagged.  CG is
actually two jagged lines, which sometimes cross.

BF and DF are lines of gliders headed southwest and southeast.

AC and CD are lines of LWSSs headed toward C.  At C, they crash to form
gliders headed northwest (CI) and northeast (CJ).

At H some of the gliders reflect toward the northwest, forming HK. The
rest escape, forming HJ.

At K the gliders reflect again, toward the northeast, forming KL.

At L they reflect again, toward the southwest, forming LM.

At G some of the northwestward gliders hit gliders in BF, forming
blinkers which are the other part of CG.  The rest escape, forming GI.

In generation t, some of the coordinates are (asymptotically):

    A=(-t/2,0)      B=(-t/6,0)     D=(t/6,0)    E=(t/2,0)    F=(0,t/2)
    I=(-t/4,t/4)    J=(t/4,t/4)    M=(-t/4,-t/4)

If the collision point C didn't drift, then the coordinates of the
other points would be:

    C=(0,0)           G=(-t/8,t/8)    H=(t/8,t/8)    K=(-t/10,t/5)
    L=(t/11,5t/22)

But it does drift, and I don't know if it oscillates back and forth,
or moves slowly but steadily in one direction.  (In gen 17409 it's moved
260 units west; in gen 72609 it's 700 units east.)

In addition to the headon LWSS crashes at C, the glider+LWSS crashes
at B and D, the kickbacks at H, K, and L, and the glider+glider ->
blinker collisions at G, there are some other reactions that occur
occasionally:

When C drifts far enough to the left, one of the gliders on CH may hit
one of the blinkers, turning it into a pond; this first happens at gen
11986.  A subsequent glider on the same path turns it into a block (first
happens at 12056), and a third glider deletes it (first at 12300).

Sometimes a glider on LM will hit a glider on CG, deleting both (first at
gen 11808).  And sometimes an LM glider will hit an eastward LWSS on BC;
this is a ternary reaction which deletes the glider and 2 LWSSs (first at
gen 5393).

Unless I've overlooked something, that's all that ever happens.

The open question here is what happens to the collision point C.  Does it
drift infinitely far west?  Infinitely far east?  Both?
