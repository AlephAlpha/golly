#C Without the block, this is Gosper's "total aperiodic"
#C  pattern (Nov '97), in which every cell in the universe
#C  eventually becomes aperiodic.
#C With the block, every cell eventually becomes periodic,
#C  but incredibly slowly. The block remains untouched for
#C  very roughly 3^63 generations. It deletes the nth glider
#C  (and is shifted) at about generation 3^(57.5+5.5n).
