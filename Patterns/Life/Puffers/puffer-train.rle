#C Puffer train
#C This was created simply by perturbing the sides of a B-heptomino
#C with two LWSS's. A B-heptomino is a naturally occurring object,
#C a precursor to the Herschel pattern, which lurches forward at the
#C speed c/2 before its own debris usually destroys it.
#C -- Not in this case!  The LWSS escorts keep the B-heptomino alive.
#C From Alan Hensel's "lifebc" pattern collection.
