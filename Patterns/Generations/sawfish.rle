#C The most spectacular of several naturally occuring puffer engines
#C found by Tony Smith during the first day of running Generations
#C 3458/37/4, a previously neglected rule with several other
#C surprises. While moving laterally at c/2, the sawfish puffer engine
#C alternates left-right with period 40*2, forming 5 blocks and a
#C period 250 switch engine which moves away diagonally 2 cells per
#C half cycle, each switch engine phase being repeated 1016 cells back
#C and 16 cells further away from the stable core axis.
