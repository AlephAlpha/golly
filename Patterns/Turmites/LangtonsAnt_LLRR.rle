# An extension of Langton's Ant to multiple colors. This example has the 
# specification "LLRR", meaning that on the four colors 0, 1, 2 and 3, the 
# ant turns left, left, right and right, respectively.
#
# The color of the square is always changed to the next color in order, in 
# a cyclical fashion: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0
#
# The LLRR ant makes a symmetrical cardioid shape as it grows. The behavior 
# of these ants was investigated in a 1995 paper:
#
# Gale, D.; J. Propp, S. Sutherland, S.Troubetzkoy (1995). 
# "Further Travels with My Ant". 
# Mathematical Entertainments column, Mathematical Intelligencer 17: 48â€“56.

# The rule tree was generated by this script:

x = 1, y = 1, rule = LangtonsAnt_LLRR
