# Langton's Ant on a triangular grid.
#
# This turmite has the same instructions as the normal Langton's Ant: turn right
# on 0, left on 1 - but works on a triangular grid instead of a square one.
#
# Unlike the square grid ant, some patterns on the triangular grid cause the ant
# to follow a bounded trajectory. This pattern has period 92.
