# Three-state, five-neighbor CA for a universal computer.
# (Appendix II)
#
# While Banks's Appendix I rule (Banks-I) required an infinite extent
# to be computation universal, his Appendix II rule seen here allows
# a construction to grow its memory space as required.
# 
# At the top are shown various wires and signals. Two signals that
# collide head-on either annihilate each other or pass through each
# other, depending on their initial separation.
# 
# Below, junctions can be used to fan-out the signals, and for making
# turns. Where two signals meet at right angles they pass through each
# other (crossover). Where three signals meet they annihilate each other.
#
# If a wire ends with a single cell as shown, a signal causes it to
# extend by two cells. An echo signal is generated, though this can
# easily be destroyed by a second signal if required.
#
# A wire can be extended at each end by a bouncing signal, for a bit 
# of fun.
#
# In the lower-right is shown a repeater-emitter reminiscent of
# Langton's Loops. Two signals are sent around a loop and down an
# extender wire.
