# An organ that can discriminate between 6 signals and 7 signals. It uses
# two compact "7-transforms" and a special T-junction structure to direct the 
# flow of signals appropriately. Unlike in Codd's CA, these structures are 
# initialised by the sheathing structure.

#   "I recall two other important components. One was a miniature 7-transform.
# Any signal that went through it came out as a 7. ... [And then] there was a 
# 6-7 discriminator. This latter one had an input and two outputs (sort of like 
# a T junction, but with a more complex structure at the junction). If a 6 came 
# in the input a 7 would go out one of the outputs. If a 7 came in the input a 7
# would go out the other output.  This one required some minor modification to 
# the collision rules -- actually addition of rules to handle collision of 
# different signals -- Codd only defined collision of identical signals."
