# Construction arm demo
#
# In this demo, a construction arm moves into position and writes a cell
# before retracting back to its starting position. Hit 'm8' to see the 
# target area more closely, and set the demo running at a slow speed.
#
# Three 'advance' signals (76) arrive first, moving the construction arm
# forwards three cells. The next signal (4456) turns the construction 
# arm left. It then advances three more cells before turning right (5546)
# and advancing three more cells. A 'mark' signal is sent (764576) to
# write a cell (state 1) and the construction arm then retracts. The 
# correct sequence of retract (4566), retract-left (5666) and 
# retract-right (4666) is needed to retrace the path of the arm.
#
# By scanning across an empty area, the construction arm can write any 
# pattern of cells in state 1. The pattern can then be sheathed and 
# triggered, to bring it to life. See sheathing-demo.rle and 
# golly-constructor.rle.gz for examples.
