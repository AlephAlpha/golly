# Sheathing demo
#
# In this demo a construction arm is shown approaching a written pattern. 
# In Codd's CA, only cells in state 1 can be written, so a method is provided 
# to sheath these wires to get them ready to receive signals.
#
# The construction arm first approaches (76) the injection point ('+' shape) and 
# then sends the 'inject_sheath' signal 756. This causes a 6 signal to travel
# around the bare wires, sheathing them as it goes.
#
# In this example the construction arm then retracts (4566), leaving the new 
# pattern sheathed but inactive. An 'inject_trigger' signal (67766) could instead 
# be sent, which would activate the pattern by causing a 7 signal to start 
# travelling through it. This latter method is designed to be used in 
# self-reproducing machines to cause the daughter copy to come alive.
#
# See construction-arm-demo.rle for an example of writing a pattern.
# See golly-constructor.rle.gz for an example of writing, sheathing and triggering.
