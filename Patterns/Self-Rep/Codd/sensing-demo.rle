# Sensing demo - Codd's CA
#
# Two wires are shown, one with a state 1 cell just beyond the end, the
# other without. Using the 'sense' command 70-70, the wire can detect which
# case it is without disturbing the cell.
#
# The sense command first exposes the end of the wire, then generates one of
# two 'echo signals' based on the state detected - '60' for a 0 cell, '70' for
# a 1 cell.
#
# In our examples, these signals are then removed with the gate (state 3).
#
# The end of the wire is then repaired using the sequence '40-60'.
#
# See echo-discriminator.rle for an example that shows how these echo signals
# can be used.
