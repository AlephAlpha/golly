# Gates in Codd's CA
#
# Signals can be stopped by the use of cells in state 3 embedded in 
# the sheath to the right of a signal (relative to its direction of
# travel). A gate to the signal's left allows the signal through.
#
# The wire below shows two gate cells on either side of the same point
# on a wire. This configuration has the effect of transforming signals
# into 7-0, whatever their initial state. See coders-demo.rle for coders
# that work the other way round.
#
# Gates can be constructed by injection of a 7-0 signal into the side
# of the wire to be gated. In the pattern at the bottom, a 7-0 signal is
# diverted to gate the wire. Only one 7-0 signal ever makes it to the
# dead end, the others are blocked.
