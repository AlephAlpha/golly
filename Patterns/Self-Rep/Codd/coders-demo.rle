# Coders in Codd's CA
#
# When two signals collide head-on, the result is a change in state. Here
# three coders are used to successively transform a 7-0 signal:
#
#    7-0  ->  4-0  ->  5-0  ->  6-0
#
# In Codd's CA, 7-0 signals are the main carriers of binary information,
# for logical operations and computation. For construction, they can get
# transformed into states 4, 5 and 6 using one or more coders.
#
# Signals 4, 5 and 6 can get transformed back into 7 - see gates-demo.rle.
