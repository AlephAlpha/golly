# Extend coder - Codd's CA
#
# This coder generates 7-6 signals, causing the output line to extend.
#
# Initially in the unsheathed state as it would be after construction,
# the pattern is first sheathed by the 6 signal, and then repeatedly
# triggered by a 7 signal coming from a periodic emitter.
#
# Four gates are required for the machine to function correctly. One stops
# the 7 signals from entering the lower section the wrong way. One stops
# the 6 signals from entering the upper section the wrong way. The other two
# stop these previous gates from being turned off.
#
# See construction-arm-demo.rle and golly-constructor.rle.gz for examples of
# construction. Other demos show gates, sheathing and signals.
