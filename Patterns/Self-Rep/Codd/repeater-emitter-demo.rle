# Repeater-emitter demo in Codd's CA
#
# Signals travel along state 1 wires, sheathed in state 2 cells.
#
# As in WireWorld, each signal has a trailing state to indicate its
# direction. Here the signals 7 and 6 each with their trailing 0. 
#
# T-junctions act as fan-outs - duplicating the signal onto the two
# output wires. Here the two signals circulate around the loop but are
# also copied onto the output wire.
#
# The effect of the 7-0 signal hitting the capped end is to expose the
# bare wire. When 6-0 comes along afterwards it 'repairs' this exposed
# end, restoring the sheath cells. The effect of a 7-0..6-0 signal train
# is therefore to extend the wire by one cell.
#
# By putting the 7-0..6-0 signal trains in a repeater-emitter loop, the
# extending operation happens again and again. This simple but useful
# component became the inspiration for Langton's Loops (see 
# Patterns/Loops).
