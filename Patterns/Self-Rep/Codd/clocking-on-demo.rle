# "Clocking-on" - a method for initializing a periodic pulser in Codd's CA
#
# From a starting point of quiescent cells (those in states 0,1,2) it is
# slighty tricky to cause a periodic pulser to start emitting. For example,
# if you just send a signal into a loop then it will collide with itself.
#
# One method is presented here. Three gates are created. One in the body of
# the loop itself prevents the newly-injected signal from colliding with 
# itself by only allowing signals to go around the loop in one direction. 
# Another prevents signals from the loop returning back up the injection
# wire. A third prevents later signals from disrupting the system.
