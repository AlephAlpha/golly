# Paterson's worms - Erase solid regions, leaving only points with at least# one uneaten edge, and the single point or line with an arrow.  I use# this with rules like 1252121 and 1525115, which fill regions with density# near 100%, to see the uneaten paths within the regions:  After running# such a rule for a while, I switch to this rule and run for 1 generation.# (by Dean Hickerson, 11/20/2008)# States are:## 0            empty (unvisited point or line)# 1            point that's been visited# 2,3,4        edge -  (2=line; 3=E arrow; 4=W arrow)# 5,6,7        edge /  (5=line; 6=NE arrow; 7=SW arrow)# 8,9,10       edge \  (8=line; 9=SE arrow; 10=NW arrow)# 11-16        'point with arrow', showing direction of next movement#              (11=E; 12=SE; 13=SW; 14=W; 15=NW; 16=NE)n_states:17neighborhood:Mooresymmetries:nonevar a0={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a1={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a2={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a3={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a4={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a5={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a6={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var a7={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}var line={2,5,8}# visited point dies if it has 6 lines out from it1,5,a0,2,a1,8,5,2,8,0# undirected lines dieline,a0,a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,0
