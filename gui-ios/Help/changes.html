<h2>Changes</h2>

<h3>Changes in version 1.1 (released !!! 2013)</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li> This version introduces a new rule format.  A file in the new format has a .rule
     extension and contains all the information about the rule: its name, description,
     table/tree data, and any color/icon information.  More details can be found
     <a href="formats.html#rule">here</a>.
<li> The RuleTable and RuleTree algorithms have been replaced by a new algorithm
     called RuleLoader.  If asked to load a rule called "Foo", RuleLoader will look
     for Foo.rule first, then Foo.table, then Foo.tree.
<li> If the Paste button sees pasteboard text starting with "@RULE rulename" then it will
     save the text as Documents/Rules/rulename.rule and switch to that rule.
<li> Icons can be displayed at scales 1:8, 1:16 and 1:32 by turning on the "Show icons"
     option in either the Settings tab or the Pattern tab's state picker window.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause Undo/Redo buttons to be incorrectly enabled/disabled
     after tapping STOP.
<li> Cosmetic improvements to Open tab.
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0 released August 2012</h3>
