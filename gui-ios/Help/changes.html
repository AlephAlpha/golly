<h2>Changes</h2>

<h3>Changes in version 1.1 (released October 2012)</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li> The RuleTable and RuleTree algorithms have been replaced by RuleLoader.
     If asked to load a rule called "Foo", the RuleLoader algorithm will look for
     Foo.table first, then Foo.tree.
<li> Icons can be displayed at scales 1:8, 1:16 and 1:32 by turning on the
     "Show icons" option in the Settings tab.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause Undo/Redo buttons to be incorrectly enabled/disabled
     after tapping STOP.
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0 released August 2012</h3>
